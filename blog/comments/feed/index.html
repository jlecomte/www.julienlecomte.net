		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s pretty impressive.  Why not do a sliding dovetail on both side?  Unnecessary or just too difficult on the inside curve?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Julien- thanks....I certainly haven&#039;t worked up to a Federal card table.  I have attended a couple of classes at the Philadelphia Furniture Workshop with Mario - what a great guy and a great teacher.  You should come this way sometime for one and we&#039;ll connect - Philly is a great food town and lots of furniture history....]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey, Rusty! Good to hear from you :) I have not picked the veneer yet. I will probably follow Mario Rodriguez advice and do all the veneering work on a flat surface, resaw and then glue to the apron. I also need to come up with a design for the marquetry that will be on the apron... As I told you back at FWW Live, this project is going to keep me busy for a very long time! :) The next step is to dovetail the back of the apron. Cheers! Julien (PS: I checked out your site, you&#039;ve got a lot of nice pieces there!)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Julien- nicely done and great explanation!  Looks like we have a similar setup - I&#039;ve got a popup Ridgid tablesaw and a Grizzley 555x bandsaw - in my garage....do you have the veneer yet or will you be making it?  Rusty]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Believe it or not, it is possible to reverse an M&#038;T joint even after the hide glue has set. It requires water, heat, and patience! :-)

I had to separate this DT,

after the glue had set. I used boiling water to do the job. Can you tell? Reversibility is another benefit of hide glue!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Julien 

Your spice box is beautiful love the birdseye maple drawers to me it sets it off.
You said in your video that you wish you had used a filler what kind of filler where 
you speaking about ? I have a jewlery box that I made for my grand daugter out
of walnut that I need to finish. What kind of finish did you use if you don&#039;t mind.
Thank you very much.]]></description>

		<title>Comment on A tenoning jig for the Dewalt DW745 portable table saw by Julien Lecomte</title>

		<description><![CDATA[I actually sold my Dewalt DW745 table saw and bought the Bosch 4100 instead. My primary reasons for selling the Dewalt DW745 is because it cannot handle full size (4x8) sheets, and you won&#039;t be able to use a dado blade with it. Otherwise, it will cut straight and true. Yes, the saw is very loud, louder than my Bosch table saw! However, the dust collection works better on the Dewalt than on the Bosch (I need to make some improvements to the Bosch saw to get the dust collection to work at its full potential) Hope this helps!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Happy Thanksgiving.

I am exploring the idea of purchasing the Dewalt DW745 table saw and I noticed that you are using it for woodworking projects.  The saw will be used for jewelry box projects, audio speaker cabinet construction, and small woodworking jigs made from 3/4&quot; MDF and crosscut 2 X 4&#039;s.  I have a 1/2&quot; router as well as a palm router.  I do not plan on ripping 4&#039; X 8&#039; sheet panels as I also have a circular saw.  I own an Incra Miter v27 and can replace it&#039;s stock miter gauge with it.I also own the TS-Aligner system and can tune up/dial in the saw if need be.  Assuming that the saw is properly tuned and the gear rod mod is done on the saw per Mr. Connor&#039;s user review on Amazon.com, do you believe that this saw would be appropriate for the woodworking  uses I have outlined above?  In simple terms, will the saw rip a straight and true cut?  Is the saw loud?  I ask these questions of you because most user reviews posted on the internet pertain to persons in the construction trades.  User opinions from woodworkers regarding the saw&#039;s appropriateness for woodworking is very rare or missing.  I hope to hear from you and your user opinions regarding this saw.  Oh, nice tenon jig.]]></description>
