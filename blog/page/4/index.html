			<p>After much consideration, I decided to head to the DARC observatory on Saturday night. It was a little bit of a gamble since the clear sky clock had forecast below average to average transparency, which usually means that wispy clouds would pass overhead, possibly ruining my chances of detecting the most subtle details on the faint targets I was planning to observe. But since it was the last opportunity to go out and observe during this new moon, I took the chance and hoped for the best.</p>
<p>I arrived after dark, around 6pm, and quickly setup my equipment next to Peter Nastcher and his 24&#8243; Starmaster telescope (always a prime spot) Shortly after, a &#8220;show and tell&#8221; presentation took place inside the observatory building. Dr. Bob Caton talked about some of the photographical work he&#8217;s done recently with his 4&#8243; wide field refractor and 20&#8243; Ritchey-Chretien telescope. Daniel Stefanescu talked about M1, and I briefly showed off <a href="../../2009/11/386/index.html">a few photographs of the early construction of my new 16&#8243; F/4 telescope</a>.</p>
<p>Around 8:50pm, the sky got dark enough to start observing. As expected, thin clouds were passing overhead. Thankfully, they remained to the north, and never really interfered with my plans to observe Herschel II objects in Cetus. By 10pm, the sky was completely clear, and the transparency was actually very decent. The NELM was 6.6 in Aries. After midnight, the air became slightly drier and the transparency slightly better, bumping the NELM to 6.7. The wind was non-existant. The temperature was hovering between the mid and the low 30s. The humidity was high, but the optics remained mostly dew free for the entire night.</p>
<p>Among the highlights of the night, I saw the horse head nebula (Barnard 33) for the first time, using my 12&#8243; telescope and a UHC filter. I was actually surprised by how easy it was to detect. Using a Panoptic 27 without a filter, I was even able to see it along with Alnitak (Zeta Orionis) and the Flame Nebula (NGC 2024) in the same field of view. What an incredible sight! We also looked at the horse head nebula through Peter&#8217;s 24&#8243; scope, and the horse head shape was unmistakable.</p>
<p>The deep red/pink color in M42 was very obvious around the bright blue-green core region and in the two far flung extensions. The E and F stars in the trapezium were easily detected. Finally, Sirius&#8217; companion, affectionately called &#8220;the pup&#8221;, was seen by several observers.</p>
<p>I would like to thank Dr. Lee Hoglan and Dr. Bob Caton for their continued hospitality. It was a good night, and I&#8217;m already looking forward to the next opportunity to observe there. Below is my log for the night. Cheers!</p>

<p>I have always been a pragmatic person. While designing my telescope using computer assisted design software was a very rewarding experience, I have felt a much greater sense of accomplishment making it happen. This is why I am very proud to show off the mirror box of my future telescope. This is the result of 4 nights of work at <a href="http://www.sawdustshop.com/">the sawdust shop</a> in Sunnyvale. I am very happy with the way it turned out, and look forward to getting more work done in the next few weeks! <strong>Note:</strong> click on the thumbnails below to see the full size photographs.</p>

			<p>After a short (55 minutes) and pleasant drive, I arrived at Dinosaur Point early (around 4pm) because of the new access rules, and to have plenty of time to setup my equipment. Albert Highe, George Feliz and Peter Natscher arrived shortly after and setup right next to me. Dave Cooper, Jamie Dillon, Bob Jardine and Al Howard were a little further down the parking lot. What a great team of observers! (ok, Al doesn&#8217;t really count as an observer, but he&#8217;s cool nonetheless)</p>
<p>The wind was non-existant. The temperature dropped from the low 60s to the mid to low 40s, which is not a huge difference. This always helps with the seeing, especially in large newtonians. The transparency was about average until about 9pm, when it got slightly better. At 9:30pm, I did a NELM test in Triangulum and obtained 6.3, which is pretty good for the site.</p>
<p>Since I don&#8217;t have a whole lot of Herschel 400 targets left around this time of the year, I decided to observe mostly Herschel II objects, and finished the night with a couple of galaxy groups from Alvin Huey&#8217;s &#8220;Selected small galaxy groups&#8221; observing guide. Among the highlights of the night, we observed NGC 891 and M 33 through Peter&#8217;s 24&#8243; Starmaster telescope. The views were absolutely breathtaking! We also looked at the hydrogen filaments inside M 1, which we also detected through George&#8217;s 13&#8243; scope, and to a lesser extent in my own 12&#8243; scope.</p>
<p>Overall, I was very pleased with the evening, and it reminded me of why I like Dinosaur Point so much: short easy drive, fairly good skies, setup on a paved parking lot, in bed by 2am after 6+ hours of observing! Below is my log for the night. Cheers!</p>

<p>For the past few weeks, I&#8217;ve been designing my next telescope, an Albert Highe inspired 16&#8243; dobsonian. The decision to build my own telescope stemmed from the fact that I knew exactly what I wanted, and I could not get it from any of the well known US telescope manufacturers. In addition, I wanted to learn new skills, including computer assisted design and woodworking. The image to the left is the latest rendering of the optical tube assembly as I envisioned it (click for a higher resolution image). Below are my original specifications:</p>
<p><br style="clear:both;line-height:0;"/></p>
<ul>
<li>The mirror box and rocker box must fit together within 24&#8243; x 24&#8243; x 18&#8243;, so that it fits in my car.</li>
<li>The eyepiece height cannot exceed 64&#8243;, so that I don&#8217;t have to use a step stool or a ladder.</li>
<li>The weight of the heaviest component cannot exceed 40 lbs, so that I can easily lift it.</li>
<li>Overall cost must not exceed $5,000.</li>
</ul>
<p>I opted for a 16&#8243; F/4 mirror, which should fit my goals. In the next few months, I will be posting photographs as I build and assemble the various parts that make up the telescope. Stay tuned!</p>

			<p>I had originally planned to go to the DARC observatory on Saturday night. However, due to a dismal weather forecast, I was forced to rethink my plans. The forecast for Friday night was actually looking pretty good, and an opportunity came up to go to Willow Springs. I had never been up there before, so I jumped at the opportunity, packed my gear in a hurry, and headed down to Deep Sky Ranch.</p>
<p>While driving on Little Panoche Rd, something interesting caught my eye: a tarantula was slowly crossing the roadway. On the way back this morning, I pulled over to take this photograph:</p>
<p><img src="../../../blogfiles/20091017/tarentula.jpg" width="483" height="319"></p>
<p>Willow Springs is a great place for deep sky visual observing. The sky is fairly dark, and the only really noticeable light dome, emanating from Hollister, is not much of a problem. Here is a summary of last night&#8217;s weather conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>No wind.</li>
<li>Temperatures in the low 50s.</li>
<li>Average seeing.</li>
<li>Average transparency.</li>
<li>Very high humidity: my table top and paper charts were soaked, and my eyepieces were covered in dew.</li>
</ul>
<p>Were present Steve Gottlieb, Mark Wagner, Mark Johnston, Rogelio Bernal Andreo, Richard Navarette and of course our gracious host, Kevin Ritschel. Here is a photo of famous DobZilla, Kevin&#8217;s 30&#8243; dobsonian telescope:</p>

<p>Since I am almost done with the Herschel 400 list, I had decided to start a new project: observing the galaxy groups featured in one of <a href="http://www.faintfuzzies.com/ObservingGuidebooks.htm">Alvin Huey&#8217;s free downloadable observing guides</a>: Selected Small Galaxy Groups. These galaxy groups are fascinating because they are a real test of the observer&#8217;s visual acuity and equipment. Although the brightest members are usually immediately detected, these groups reward patient observers. The more time is spent at the eyepiece, the greater the number of galaxies that become visible! This way, I was able to detect a good number of members after spending about 30 minutes on a given group. I did not take detailed notes of my observations this time around, but I did write down the list of members I was positively able to detect. All observations were done using my Meade Lightbridge 12&#8243; F/5 dobsonian telescope, and using mostly my 9mm Televue Nagler type 6.</p>

			<p>Mark Johnston, Peter Krottje and I met at the overflow parking lot at Henry Coe state park last night. I brought my Meade Lightbridge 12&#8243; (after flocking the inside of the UTA with black velvet ordered from Edmund Optics), while Mark brought both his 18&#8243; Starmaster dobsonian as well as a newly acquired equatorially mounted 190mm Orion Mak-Newt. Peter was using his homemade 10&#8243; ultra light dobsonian.</p>
<p>The sky grew darker as the evening went on thanks to the fog dimming the lights emanating from San Jose, Morgan Hill and Gilroy. By 11pm, we were getting SQM readings of almost 21.2, which is pretty good for Henry Coe. The transparency however was clearly below average, and the low level haze was causing some obvious dimming up to 15 degrees of elevation, especially to the south and the west. The sky was however more than decent between the north east and the south east, which is where I spent most of the night, observing mostly open clusters in Andromeda, Lacerta and Cassiopeia.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a summary of the weather conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Average seeing.</li>
<li>Mild (but annoying) westerly wind.</li>
<li>Surprisingly cold (I had to really bundle up, and almost needed gloves by 11pm)</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some of the highlights of the evening:</p>
<ul>
<li>18 open clusters from the Herschel 400 list. Most of them were honestly not very interesting, except maybe the ET cluster, and a couple of clusters in Cassiopeia that happened to fit within the same FOV of my Pan 27, showing some differences in structure.</li>
<li>We observed the California nebula with my 50mm finder scope using a 16mm Nagler type 5 and a UHC filter. We got a much better view through Mark&#8217;s 190mm Orion Mak-Newt using a wide field eyepiece and an H-beta filter.</li>
<li>We saw the fourth flea around NGC 7331 through Mark&#8217;s 18&#8243; scope, and I later caught a glimpse of it in my 12&#8243; scope, although it was coming in and out of view (knowing where to look really helps!)</li>
<li>The GRS was transiting. A darker slightly elongated region was spotted right next to it. Probably some disturbance in the equatorial band.</li>
<li>There was a nice shadow transit by Io on Jupiter.</li>
</ul>
<p>It was my first night using the Orion self-centering adapter (instead of a standard 1 1/4&#8243; adapter with a tightening ring) and I have to say that I really liked it! I&#8217;m sure it will be very handy this winter when switching eyepieces while wearing gloves.</p>
<p>I took off around midnight, and was soundly asleep by 1am. Overall, it was a good night, and I&#8217;m glad I went out. I&#8217;m looking forward to observing under darker skies next weekend to start on the Herschel II list, since I&#8217;m running out of Herschel I objects. Below is my log for the night. Cheers!</p>

			<p>I was only able to attend the first two nights of <a href="http://www.observers.org/CalStar/">CalStar</a>, an annual Star Party that takes place at Lake San Antonio in California. The first night (Thu, Sep 17), the transparency was mediocre (when I called it a night, around 2am, Jupiter was surrounded by a bright halo&#8230;). Therefore, I used that first night to focus on bright easy objects. The second night (Fri, Sep 18) was much better with an NELM of 6.7 in UMi. Seeing on both nights was about average. However, the high temperatures during the day caused my (thick) mirror to take many hours to cool down, even with the fan on (and I made the mistake of keeping the shroud on&#8230;)</p>
<p>Among the highlights, I was able to see Uranus (easy) and M 33 (hard) naked eye, as well as catch the two brightest satellites of Uranus with my scope. Dave Cooper and Peter Natscher also shared some superb views in their scopes (respectively an AP 6&#8243; apo refractor and a 24&#8243; F/3.7 Starmaster dobsonian telescope)</p>
<p>I thoroughly enjoyed the conversations I had during the day with fellow observers. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve come to love star parties. Even if the weather is not so great, it&#8217;s always a fantastic opportunity to learn new things.</p>
<p>Below is my log for both nights. Most objects are from the Herschel 400 list. From now on, I will start mixing in Herschel II and Herschel I objects in my observing routine, in addition to some objects from Alvin Huey&#8217;s awesome free guides: &#8220;Selected Small Galaxy Groups&#8221; and &#8220;Selected Galaxy Trios&#8221; (which I had printed and coil binded at Fedex Kinko&#8217;s) Cheers!</p>

<p><b>NGC 7142</b> OC Cep 21h45m25.3s +65°49&#8217;26&#8221; 10.0 mag 08:40pm<br />
Very inconspicuous group of about 40 moderately faint stars over a milky background. Slightly elongated WNW-ESE. A few brighter stars delimit this cluster on the north and east sides.</p>
<p><b>NGC 7331</b> GX Peg 22h37m33.1s +34°28&#8217;14&#8221; 10.2 mag 09:00pm<br />
Elongated 3&#215;1 NNW-SSE. Fairly bright core region surrounding a bright stellar nucleus visible at 217x and 305x during brief moments of better seeing. The halo is rather dim compared to the core. It extends about 6&#8242; along its major axis. The western half of the galaxy looks darker, due to the presence of a dark lane. Very faint superimposed star about 2&#8242; SSE of nucleus.  NGC 7335, NGC 7337 and NGC 7340 were easily detected. NGC 7336 was not detected. I did not search for nearby NGC 7325 and NGC 7326.</p>
<p><b>NGC 6210</b> (Turtle Nebula) PN Her 16h44m54.4s +23°47&#8217;05&#8221; 9.7 mag 09:25pm<br />
At 95x, this planetary nebula appears bright, almost stellar, and exhibits an obvious blue color. At 217x and 305x, the color is a bit washed out. At those magnifications, this planetary nebula appears round and very uniform, about 10 to 15&#8243; in diameter, and seems to be surrounded by a slightly larger and rather faint envelope (unless this is scattered light). I did not detect a central star.</p>
<p><b>NGC 6572</b> (Blue Racquetball) PN Oph 18h12m35.8s +06°51&#8217;28&#8221; 8.0 mag 09:40pm<br />
At 95x, this planetary nebula appears bright, stellar, and exhibits an obvious blue color. At 217x and 305x, the color is a bit washed out. At those magnifications, this planetary nebula appears very uniform, roughly 10&#8243; in diameter, and seems surrounded by a very faint envelope about 3 times the size of the nebula (unless this is scattered light). I did not detect a central star.  There is a faint group of a dozen stars 10&#8242; west.</p>
<p><b>NGC 7217</b> GX Peg 22h08m20.6s +31°24&#8217;39&#8221; 11.1 mag 10:35pm<br />
Bright, round non stellar core surrounded by a larger, relatively bright uniform halo. Faint superimposed star less than 1&#8242; NNE of the core.</p>
<p><b>NGC 7814</b> GX Peg 00h03m47.1s +16°12&#8217;11&#8221; 11.6 mag 10:50pm<br />
Moderately bright and large. Appears roundish at first, progressively brighter toward its center. At higher magnification and with careful examination, a faint halo extending NW-SE can be detected. The bisecting dust lane obvious on photographs was not seen.</p>
<p><b>NGC 7448</b> GX Peg 23h00m34.6s +16°02&#8217;10&#8221; 12.1 mag 11:00pm<br />
Pretty small, moderately bright, elongated 2&#215;1 NNW-SSE, faint nucleus seen intermittently at high magnification. Suspected the detached segment that makes this galaxy peculiar to be at the northern tip of the galaxy.</p>
<p><b>Mayall II</b> (M31-G1) GC And 00h33m20.0s +39°38&#8217;04&#8221; 13.7 mag 12:20am<br />
Appears faint and stellar, thus requiring a very detailed chart to find! Forms a very tight triangle with two field stars. In order to confirm the observation, I sketched a few field stars along with the position of the presumed globular. The result is very close to the sketch published by Sue French in the December 2005 issue of Sky &#038; Telescope&#8217;s Deep Sky Wonder column. I believe that excellent seeing and high magnification are essential to see the non-stellar nature of this target.</p>
<p><b>NGC 205</b> (M 110) GX And 00h40m56.5s +41°44&#8217;30&#8221; 8.9 mag 12:30am<br />
Fairly large and bright, elongated 2&#215;1 NW-SE, gradually brighter to a stellar nucleus.</p>
<p><b>NGC 891</b> GX And 02h23m12.6s +42°23&#8217;30&#8221; 10.9 mag 12:45am<br />
Moderately faint, elongated roughly 6&#215;1 NNE-SSW, about 12&#8242; along its major axis. The dust lane splitting this galaxy in half is clearly visible only through the central bulge. Several fairly bright stars are superimposed.  Peter Natscher&#8217;s 24&#8243; scope showed the bisecting dust lane much more clearly, along with some mottling.</p>
<p><b>NGC 7293</b> (Helix) PN Aqr 22h30m12.6s -20°47&#8217;05&#8221; 6.3 mag 12:55am<br />
Large, fairly dim, best seen using a UHC filter at low power. The ring structure, very slightly elongated NW-SE, can easily be seen. The NW and SE portions of the rim are clearly dimmer. A few superimposed stars, including what appears to be the central star, can be seen inside the ring over a faint background.</p>
<p><b>NGC 7662</b> (Blue Snowball) PN And 23h26m24.4s +42°35&#8217;30&#8221; 8.6 mag 01:30am<br />
At 95x, this planetary nebula appears bright, stellar, and looks slightly bluish. At 217x and 305x, the center region of the nebula appears darker, and an elliptical ring oriented roughly E-W can be detected. What I failed to see is the lumpy texture of the ring, beautifully documented in the October 2009 issue of Astronomy Now&#8217;s Drawn To The Universe column.</p>
<h3>Friday, September 18, 2009</h3>
<p><b>NGC 6822</b> (Barnard&#8217;s Galaxy) GX Sgr 19h45m32.4s -14°46&#8217;43&#8221; 9.4 mag 08:30pm<br />
Large (roughly 15&#8242; x 10&#8242;), elongated NNE-SSW, extremely pale, very easy to miss when sweeping the area, which is probably why this galaxy was missed by Herschel and was discovered so late (Barnard, 1881). There are a few superimposed stars throughout. A couple of small knots (probably HII regions) were seen using a UHC filter (although I did not note their position) This galaxy is part of the Local Group of galaxies.</p>
<p><b>NGC 7027</b> PN Cyg 21h07m25.2s +42°16&#8217;47&#8221; 9.6 mag 08:50pm<br />
Small, bright, exhibiting an obvious blue color, elongated 3:2 NW-SE, rectangular in shape, slightly wider on the NW side. A faint outer envelope, about twice the size of the nebula, was suspected (unless it could be scattered light)</p>
<p><b>NGC 6503</b> GX Dra 17h49m20.4s +70°08&#8217;46&#8221; 10.8 mag 09:15pm<br />
Fairly bright, moderately large, elongated 3&#215;1 WNW-ESE, fairly uniform with only a slight brightening of the core region. Detected a very weak nucleus or superimposed star.</p>
<p><b>NGC 7023</b> BN Cep 21h01m45.3s +68°12&#8217;26&#8221;  mag 09:40pm<br />
Fairly dim nebulosity, roughly 2&#8242; in diameter, around V380 Cep (mag 7.4). Dim patch around 2 to 3&#8242; south of V380 Cep (photographs confirm the presence of this extension). A UHC filter makes the nebula disappear, confirming its reflective nature.</p>
<p><b>NGC 7479</b> GX Peg 23h05m28.0s +12°22&#8217;45&#8221; 11.7 mag 10:20pm<br />
Moderately bright, fairly small, elongated 5:2 N-S, weak fairly large core. Moderately bright (mag 12.9) superimposed star at the northern end, slightly dimmer (mag 13.7) star about 1&#8242; SW of the center. Suspected some mottling in the core. This galaxy is actually a barred spiral. The arms should be visible under better conditions and with a slightly larger scope.</p>
<p><b>NGC 7078</b> (M 15) GC Peg 21h30m28.0s +12°12&#8217;47&#8221; 6.3 mag 10:25pm<br />
Fairly large, very bright, very intense core, resolved throughout. Located about 7&#8242; SW of a bright (mag 7.6) star.</p>
<p><b>NGC 7099</b> (M 30) GC Cap 21h40m57.3s -23°07&#8217;56&#8221; 6.9 mag 10:35pm<br />
Moderately large and bright, well defined core, well resolved throughout. The SE region looks darker. Quite a few brighter stars are visible in the halo.</p>
<p><b>NGC 404</b> (Mirach&#8217;s Ghost) GX And 01h10m01.9s +35°46&#8217;21&#8221; 11.2 mag 11:00pm<br />
Located about 7&#8242; NW of Mirach (Beta And), a mag 2.0 star exhibiting a beautiful golden color. Moderately bright and small, round, gradually brighter to a fairly bright stellar nucleus best seen at high magnification.</p>
<p><b>NGC 628</b> (M 74) GX Psc 01h37m15.2s +15°50&#8217;11&#8221; 9.7 mag 11:35pm<br />
Fairly bright and small core embedded inside a large round faint halo showing hints of mottling at higher magnification. Very faint superimposed star within 1&#8242; ESE of the center, slightly brighter one about 1.5&#8242; ENE. Spiral structure better seen in Peter Natscher&#8217;s 24&#8243; scope.</p>
<p><b>NGC 7606</b> GX Aqr 23h19m37.3s -08°25&#8217;42&#8221; 11.7 mag 12:10am<br />
Moderately large and bright, elongated 2&#215;1 NNW-SSE, fairly bright stellar core, uniform halo.</p>
<p><b>NGC 7727</b> GX Aqr 23h40m26.2s -12°14&#8217;02&#8221; 11.6 mag 12:20am<br />
Fairly small and bright, small round intense core, round uniform halo. NGC 7723 and NGC 7724 nearby.</p>
<p><b>NGC 7723</b> GX Aqr 23h39m29.4s -12°54&#8217;15&#8221; 11.9 mag 12:25am<br />
Fairly small, moderately faint, moderately bright stellar nucleus surrounded by a fairly uniform halo elongated 3:2 NE-SW. Located about 20&#8242; ENE of a bright yellow double star. NGC 7727 and NGC 7724 nearby.</p>
<p><b>NGC 253</b> (Sculptor Galaxy) GX Scl 00h48m04.1s -25°13&#8217;53&#8221; 7.9 mag 12:45am<br />
Very easily seen along globular cluster NGC 288 in 9&#215;50 finder scope. Very large and bright, elongated 6&#215;1 NE-SW. The core region is large, bright, and shows some obvious mottling (seen even better in Peter Natscher&#8217;s 24&#8243; scope). Numerous fairly bright field stars are superimposed.</p>

				<a href="../../2009/09/314/index.html" rel="bookmark">A Better Implementation Of The Input Prompt Pattern</a>
			</h1>
								</header><!-- .entry-header -->

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>The Input Prompt pattern consists in prefilling a text field with a prompt as a way of supplying help information for controls whose purpose or format may not be immediately clear. In the browser, this pattern is most often implemented by dynamically modifying the <code>value</code> property of a text field element via the <code>focus</code> and <code>blur</code> event handlers attached to the text field, as shown in this example (<a href="../../../blogfiles/20090914/test-search-label-accessibility1.html">live demo</a>):</p>
<p>CSS:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code>.hint {
  color: #999;
}</code></pre>
<p>Markup:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code>&#60;input type="text" id="sbx"&#62;</code></pre>
<p>JavaScript (based on YUI 3.0.0):</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code>YUI().use('node', function (Y) {

    var sbx = Y.get('#sbx');

    Y.on('domready', function () {

        sbx.set('value', 'Search');
        sbx.addClass('hint');

        Y.on('focus', function () {
            if (this.get('value') === 'Search') {
                this.set('value', '');
                this.removeClass('hint');
            }
        }, sbx);

        Y.on('blur', function () {
            if (this.get('value') === '') {
                this.set('value', 'Search');
                this.addClass('hint');
            }
        }, sbx);

    });
});</code></pre>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> the code is intentionally implemented inside a <code>domready</code> event handler to work around issues related to form field caching.</p>
<p>The main problem with implementing this pattern using the <code>value</code> property is that the default text is used if the form is submitted while the input prompt is showing. Trying to work around this by testing the content of the text field when the form is submitted makes the default text impossible to use as a value. Another side effect of this implementation is that most developers will forget to attach a <code>&lt;label&gt;</code> element to the text field, leading to a confusing experience for screen reader users as they lack the necessary context to understand the purpose of the control.</p>
<p>A better implementation of this pattern consists in using a <code>&lt;label&gt;</code> element and positioning it on top of the text field it is attached to. Here is an example of this implementation (<a href="../../../blogfiles/20090914/test-search-label-accessibility2.html">live demo</a>):</p>
<p>CSS:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code>#container {
    position: relative;
}

#container label {
    position: absolute;
    top: 4px; *top: 6px; left: 3px;
    color: #999;
    cursor: text;
}

#container label.offscreen {
    left: -9999px;
}</code></pre>
<p>Markup:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code>&#60;div id="container"&#62;
    &#60;label for="sbx" class="offscreen">Search&#60;/label&#62;
    &#60;input type="text" id="sbx"&#62;
&#60;/div&#62;</code></pre>
<p>JavaScript (based on YUI 3.0.0):</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code>YUI().use('node', function (Y) {

    var sbx = Y.get('#sbx'),
        lbl = Y.get('#container label');

    Y.on('domready', function () {

        sbx.set('value', '');
        lbl.removeClass('offscreen');

        Y.on('mousedown', function () {
            setTimeout(function () {
                sbx.focus();
            }, 0);
        }, lbl);

        Y.on('focus', function () {
            lbl.addClass('offscreen');
        }, sbx);

        Y.on('blur', function () {
            if (sbx.get('value') === '') {
                sbx.set('value', '');
                lbl.removeClass('offscreen');
            }
        }, sbx);

    });
});</code></pre>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>A lot of people showed up for some stargazing at the overflow parking lot at Henry Coe state park. The conditions were pretty good overall:</p>
<ul>
<li>Light winds coming from the north west</li>
<li>Temperature in the high to mid 60s</li>
<li>Good seeing</li>
<li>Average transparency</li>

<p>While waiting for the sky to turn dark, I pointed my scope toward Antares, which was showing a fairly clean split while still high in the southern sky. The dim companion, a white dwarf, was located just to the west of the red giant.</p>
<p>I then spent most of the evening tracking down some bright targets from the Herschel 400 list. Among the highlights, the Saturn nebula (NGC 7009) was showing a lot of details (see description below)</p>
<p>Before wrapping up around 1am, I looked at Jupiter. The view was absolutely incredible, although the wind proved to be a bit of a problem with my light weight scope. The great red spot was more colorful than I can ever remember. Its color used to be a very delicate pink mixed with a little bit of gray a few years ago. But this time, it was definitely orange. A lot of tiny details could be spotted throughout the bands, and even in the polar regions! What a view to behold!</p>
<p>Here are my observations. Overall, it was a good night, and I&#8217;m glad I went out. Cheers!</p>

At low power (95x), this planetary nebula appears small, fairly bright, elongated 3:2 WNW-ESE, and exhibits a delicate blue/green color. At higher magnification (217x and 305x), the center of the nebula appears very slightly darker. Faint extensions show up on both sides of the oval disk, terminated by a tiny slightly brighter knot. The extension on the ESE side seems to slightly bend toward the NE. Finally, during brief moments of better seeing, a ring elongated 2:1 appears inside the nebula. The central star was not detected.</p>

			<p>I went to the D.A.R.C. observatory last Saturday to observe or re-observe a few Herschel 400 summer objects, as well as enjoy some eye candy under a dark sky. I was setup right next to Dennis Beckley and his classic Obsession 18&#8243;. Here is a summary of the weather conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wind died down shortly after sunset</li>
<li>Temperature in the low 70s</li>
<li>Good seeing (6 to 7 on the Pickering scale)</li>
<li>Average transparency (the light dome from Los Banos, which I use as an indication of the moisture content in the atmosphere, was fairly conspicuous)</li>
<li>NELM 6.7 in Lyra</li>
<li>Thin clouds started showing up around 1am from the east</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, it was a pretty good night, although not as good as what the D.A.R.C. observatory has proven capable of. Among the highlights of the night, I got to observe Triton for the first time. The Jupiter impact mark was seen very easily, and Jupiter&#8217;s satellites were resolved as tiny discs of different diameters. The &#8220;ink spot&#8221; (Barnard 86 located right next to OC NGC 6520) looked absolutely remarkable. Stephan&#8217;s quintet was looking pretty good in my scope, and was easy in Dennis&#8217; 18&#8243; scope. Finally, I really enjoyed looking at V Aql, a fairly bright carbon star of deep orange color with a tinge of red. What is interesting about this star, beyond its striking color, is the presence of planetary nebula NGC 6751 about 30&#8242; SE. It is therefore possible to fit both objects within the same field of view in modest amateur telescopes (8 to 12&#8243;), portraying two stages of stellar evolution as the carbon star will eventually become a planetary nebula in a not so distant future.</p>
<p>On Sunday morning, I had an immense satisfaction when I looked at a DSS image of galaxy NGC 6217 (Arp 185), and noticed that my notes (see below) were absolutely right on! I find it absolutely amazing that such wispy details can be detected with such a small aperture under a good dark sky.</p>
<p>I cannot end this report without thanking Dr. Lee Hoglan for letting us observe on his property. Below is my log for the night. Cheers!</p>
