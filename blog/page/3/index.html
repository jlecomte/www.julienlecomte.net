			<p>When I showed up at the entrance of the Hollister BLM access road, off of Little Panoche Rd, around 7pm, I saw Dr. Lee Hoglan, Craig Scull, Peter Nastcher, Tony Hurtado and Mark Johnston fiddling with the gate. Apparently, a land owner had added their own combo lock in addition to the existing lock, and nobody knew the combination code! As I was privately entertaining the idea of setting up my equipment on the gravel area in front of the gate, Lee decided to cut off the chain with a hack saw blade. At first, I didn&#8217;t think that it was going to work, but apparently, Lee had learned quite a few tricks while at Folsom, and managed to cut off one of the links in about 10 minutes (thank God for soft steel chains!). Using a pair of pliers, I then twisted the link and managed to open the gate. Victory!</p>
<p>We proceeded to setup on the large flat area in front of the observatory. It was a bit breezy early on, but the wind died down after sunset as it is often the case in that area. It was quite warm all night, and I was observing in nothing more than a pair of shorts and a thin long sleeve shirt.</p>
<p>After collimating, we looked at Venus, Saturn and the Moon, which were all pretty low over the western horizon, and noticed that the seeing was quite good! Antares&#8217; companion was readily visible in my 12&#8243; scope. Always a good sign!</p>
<p>In the middle of the night, Peter noticed that his scope was out of collimation. We later found out that it was due to the support of his secondary mirror getting loose. This incident prompted me to check my own collimation since I, too, was starting to see more coma than I am used to. Indeed, my collimation was a little off, and after adjusting the mirrors, everything became crisper. I don&#8217;t know what caused that shift on my scope, but I decided not to worry about it for now.</p>
<p>After midnight, the seeing went from good to spectacular. Peter was showing off Jupiter through his 24&#8243; StarMaster telescope armed with a binoviewer and a neutral density filter. This was the best view of Jupiter I have ever had. A lot of very fine details could be seen within the bands. The satellites were seen as tiny little discs of varying diameters and colors, making it easy to identify them. The GRS was crossing Jupiter&#8217;s meridian, followed by a long thin dark band (maybe signaling the reapparition of the SEB?)</p>
<p>Lyra&#8217;s double-double was showing a very clean split, and Peter suggested to try 72 Peg, which members are separated by only 0.5&#8243;. Sure enough, using my 12&#8243; scope, two tiny Airy discs touching each other were intermittently visible.</p>
<p>The transparency was good but not great. Jupiter was showing a tiny halo, and my NELM estimate was around 6.6, which is slightly below what the site is capable of. Nevertheless, M33 was fairly easily visible using averted vision, which I consider a good test for darkness and transparency.</p>
<p>As far as my observing log, this was not a night for the record books. I only logged the following 5 (new to me) objects:</p>
<p><b>M1-92</b> (Minkowski&#8217;s Footprint) PN Cyg 19 36 46 +29 34 28 11.0 2010-08-14 09:35pm<br />
Appears as a fairly bright fuzzy star at 305x, confirmed at 610x. It seemed extremely slightly elongated WNW-ESE with tiny faint extensions in the same direction (?) Forms a small triangle with two field stars of relatively comparable brightness. I did not try using a narrow band filter since I knew in advance that it would not help.</p>
<p><b>HP 1</b> (Haute-Provence 1) GC Oph 17 31 47 -29 59 26 12.5 2010-08-14 10:15pm<br />
Very pale round glow 45&#8243; in diameter. Confirmed the location with Mark Johnston&#8217;s 18&#8243; StarMaster telescope. In that scope, a tiny (10&#8243;) core, only very slightly brighter than the surrounding glow, was suspected (?)</p>
<p><b>Djorgovski</b> 2 GC Sgr 18 02 31 -27 49 34 9.9 2010-08-14 11:00pm<br />
Faint round glow 1.5&#8242; in diameter located 20&#8242; W of the famous ink spot (B86) and its neighboring open cluster NGC 6520. Positioned in the center of a keystone shaped asterism formed by 4 fairly bright stars. Another small (unnamed?) dark nebula is located 5&#8242; WNW. A very faint superimposed star was detected at the northern end of the cluster, and another one was also seen intermittently at the western end. Not sure whether these belong to the cluster or are simply field stars.</p>
<p><b>NGC 6412</b> (Arp 38) GX Dra 17 29 16 +75 42 06 12.4 2010-08-14 11:15pm<br />
Bright stellar nucleus surrounded by a diffuse featureless halo measuring 1.5&#8242; in diameter. A faint smudge was spotted 10&#8242; NW (?)</p>
<p><b>NGC 6621</b> (Arp 81) GX Dra 18 12 54 +68 22 15 13.3 2010-08-15 12:05am<br />
Faint diffuse glow 1.5&#8217;x30&#8243; elongated NW-SE containing two small condensations. The slightly larger and brighter one to the NW is the core of galaxy NGC 6621, while the other one is the core of its companion galaxy NGC 6622. A faint (mag. 15.3) star is located just 30&#8243; E of the core of NGC 6622.</p>
<p>I also tried to look at a number of tough objects, including Djorgovski 1 and the Aquarius Dwarf, but was not able to see them.</p>
<p>I finished the night with a quick look at a couple of galaxy groups in Pegasus using one of Alvin&#8217;s observing guides. I also looked at some of my favorites, including Stephan&#8217;s quintet, the Deer Lick group and M33.</p>

			<p>GSSP 2010 turned out to be a terrific star party, and I would like to start this report by personally thanking our hosts, the Albaugh family, as well as all the volunteers who made this event such a great success!</p>
<p>The conditions were good all 4 nights. The NELM hovered in the 6.8/7.0 range. Given the amount of haze that was clearly visible during the day, and especially shortly after sunset, I feel that the site used for GSSP could easily yield mag. 7.2 or better skies when the air is drier. The seeing was average most of the time, although a bit off on the first and the last night.</p>
<p>I had prepared a list of 58 objects drawn mostly from the Herschel II, DeepMap 600 and Tac Eye Candy lists. I also added a few Palomar globular clusters and obscure summer time planetaries, just for the heck of it. I ended up logging 48 new objects. Below is my log for all 4 nights. See you at GSSP 2011!</p>

<p><b>NGC 6070</b> GX Ser 16 10 33 +00 40 55 12.4 2010-07-10 10:40pm<br />
Fairly faint, relatively uniform, diffuse halo about 3&#8217;x1.5&#8242; ENE-WSW. Faint stellar nucleus glimpsed using averted vision. Located 8&#8242; SSE of a bright (mag. 6.7) yellow star. Two moderately faint stars were seen just outside the eastern end of the halo. PGC 57350 was detected as a small and very faint smudge 5&#8242; ENE.</p>
<p><b>NGC 6106</b> GX Her 16 19 20 +07 23 10 12.8 2010-07-10 10:55pm<br />
1&#8217;x45&#8243; NNW-SSE, fairly faint, relatively uniform, very slightly brighter core, faint stellar nucleus or superimposed star glimpsed using averted vision. Extremely faint star (mag. 14.4!) at the northern end, just outside the halo. Slightly brighter star (mag. 14.6!) located 1&#8242; S. The difference in the appreciation of their brightness is probably due to the fact that the first one is actually superimposed over the halo. Two fairly bright field stars are 10&#8242; SSW and SW.</p>
<p><b>NGC 6181</b> GX Her 16 32 50 +19 48 22 12.2 2010-07-10 11:05pm<br />
1.5&#8217;x1&#8242; NNE-SSW. Fairly bright small core or stellar nucleus. Moderately faint diffuse halo which appears uneven. Traces of a spiral arm extending NNE, and possibly a smaller and dimmer symmetrical one. Extremely faint superimposed star at the northern end (about 45&#8242; N of nucleus)</p>
<p><b>B 92</b> (Black Hole) DN Sgr 18 16 09 -18 10 45 O6 2010-07-11 12:10am<br />
Superimposed over the Small Sagitarius Star Cloud (M24) and visible in the same field of view of the Televue Panoptic 27mm with B93 and NGC 6603, this dark nebula measures 15&#8217;x8&#8242;, is oriented roughly N-S, and features a single fairly bright superimposed star located just E of the center.</p>
<p><b>Palomar 8</b> GC Sgr 18 42 10 -19 48 56 10.9 2010-07-11 12:20am<br />
Round, about 1.5&#8242; in diameter, moderately faint, uniform and unresolved smudge. Moderately faint star just south (?). 3 or 4 stars, either superimposed field stars or physically belonging to the cluster, were detected.</p>
<p><b>IC 1295</b> PN Sct 18 55 14 -08 48 46 12.7 2010-07-11 12:45am<br />
Visible at 95x without filter and with globular cluster NGC 6712 in the same field of view. At 217x + OIII filter, I see a faint roundish disk about 2&#8242; in diameter, relatively uniform with traces of annularity.</p>
<p><b>NGC 6717</b> (Palomar 9) GC Sgr 18 55 46 -22 41 13 8.4 2010-07-11 01:00am<br />
About 45&#8243;x30&#8243; E-W, moderately faint. Half a dozen stars are resolved. Located 2&#8242; S of a bright yellow/orange star.</p>
<p><b>NGC 6814</b> GX Aql 19 43 17 -10 17 48 12.1 2010-07-11 01:35am<br />
Moderately bright almost stellar core. Faint, round, diffuse halo, about 2&#8242; in diameter, showing hints of mottling. Faint superimposed star 30&#8243; W.</p>
<p><b>Palomar 11</b> GC Aql 19 45 50 -07 58 45 9.8 2010-07-11 01:45am<br />
Very faint round haze with a dozen superimposed field stars extending over an area roughly 5&#8242; in diameter. Located just 6&#8242; SSE of a fairly bright (mag. 8.6) field star.</p>
<p><b>NGC 6907</b> GX Cap 20 25 46 -24 46 17 11.9 2010-07-11 01:50am<br />
Moderately faint core, about 30&#8243; in diameter. Faint halo, about 2&#8217;x1.2&#8242; extending E-W. A small and faint detached knot is visible just NE of the core. Using averted vision, it&#8217;s pretty clear that it&#8217;s a spiral arm.</p>
<p><b>NGC 6991</b> OC Cyg 20 55 17 +47 27 25   2010-07-11 02:15am<br />
Roughly 60 fairly bright stars of similar brightness within an area 30&#8242; in diameter. A couple of chains, each made up of 5 or 6 stars, are visible in the western half. A bright, slightly yellow star is located at the eastern end of the cluster.</p>
<p><b>M 2-9</b> (Minkowski&#8217;s Butterfly) PN Oph 17 06 15 -10 09 26 13.2 2010-07-11 10:40pm<br />
Extremely faint nebulosity, extending approximately 30&#8243;x10&#8243; N-S. The central star is moderately faint. For some reason, the use of an O-III filter did not seem to help much.</p>
<p><b>NGC 6309</b> (Box Nebula) PN Oph 17 14 42 -12 55 22 11.6 2010-07-11 10:50pm<br />
Appears as an out of focus star at 95x. Blinks well using an O-III filter. Best seen at 305x. Measures roughly 20&#8243;x12&#8243; extending NNW-SSE. Fairly uniform. The northern half seems a bit brighter. A moderately faint (mag. 11.5) star is located 15&#8243; NNW. A very faint (mag. 15.0) star is 45&#8243; E. Finally, an extremely faint star is located just 5&#8243; W (?)</p>
<p><b>NGC 6340</b> GX Dra 17 10 17 +72 17 38 12.0 2010-07-11 11:05pm<br />
Moderately bright stellar nucleus. Gradually fainter round diffuse halo about 1.5&#8242; in diameter. Faint galaxy (IC 1251) about 7&#8242; NNW seen easily. Another one (IC 1254), just barely seen, is located 10&#8242; NE.</p>
<p><b>NGC 6507</b> OC Sgr 18 00 29 -17 27 01 9.6 2010-07-11 11:30pm<br />
Sparse group of two dozen moderately bright to fairly faint stars in an area measuring roughly 10&#8242; in diameter.</p>
<p><b>IC 1276</b> (Palomar 7) GC Ser 18 11 21 -07 12 37 10.3 2010-07-11 11:35pm<br />
Extremely faint round smudge, about 2&#8242; in diameter, seen using averted vision only, and surrounding two fairly faint stars separated by about 45&#8243; on an E-W line. An extremely faint star is located 1.2&#8242; E. Two moderately bright stars are roughly 3.5&#8242; N and NNE respectively.</p>
<p><b>NGC 6596</b> OC Sgr 18 18 12 -16 38 43   2010-07-11 11:45pm<br />
Two dozen fairly bright to moderately faint stars within an area 10&#8242; in diameter. Not very well detached from that part of the Milky Way. A dozen stars are arranged in a &#8220;C&#8221; shape.</p>
<p><b>NGC 6604</b> OC Ser 18 18 40 -12 14 12 7.5 2010-07-12 12:00am<br />
5 fairly bright stars arranged in a trapezoidal shape roughly 2&#8217;x1&#8242; E-W, the brightest member being slightly yellow. A few slightly dimmer stars are spread out within a few arc minutes.</p>
<p><b>NGC 6631</b> OC Sct 18 27 48 -12 01 21 11.7 2010-07-12 12:05am<br />
About 20 fairly faint stars within 5&#8242;. Another small group is located about 10&#8242; SE. Is it part of the same cluster?</p>
<p><b>NGC 6819</b> OC Cyg 19 41 42 +40 12 45 9.5 2010-07-12 01:10am<br />
About 25 moderately faint stars over a milky background within an area 4&#8242; in diameter. A round dark region about 2&#8242; in diameter is very obvious in the northern half of the cluster. A bright (mag. 6.2) yellow star is located 10&#8242; ENE while a bright (mag. 6.9) white star is only 14&#8242; SSE.</p>
<p><b>NGC 6857</b> PN Cyg 20 02 16 +33 34 13 11.4 2010-07-12 01:20am<br />
Faint round nebulosity about 30&#8243; in diameter, relatively uniform, very slightly brighter in its center. Without an O-III filter, the nebula is not very obvious, but a fairly faint superimposed star, slightly offset to the north, is visible. Is this the central star? Two moderately faint stars are located on either sides of the nebula on a NE-SW line. At 217x with an O-III filter, the nebula gives the impression of having an odd triangular shape, the northern side being flat&#8230;</p>
<p><b>NGC 6894</b> PN Cyg 20 16 51 +30 35 54 14.4 2010-07-12 01:35am<br />
Round, about 45&#8243; in diameter, fairly faint. Shows traces of ring structure, the central region, about 10&#8243; in diameter, being slightly darker. A knot is visible on the ring in the NNE direction. Since it almost completely disappears when using an O-III filter, it most likely is a superimposed star.</p>
<p><b>Abell 70</b> PN Aql 20 32 09 -07 03 01 14.3 2010-07-12 01:45am<br />
Ghostly smudge, barely visible using averted vision and an O-III filter. Seems round and uniform. It is also visible without a filter once you know exactly where to look. A moderately bright (mag. 11.1) star is located 3.5&#8242; E.</p>
<p><b>NGC 7129</b> OC Cep 21 43 16 +66 09 38 11.5 2010-07-12 02:35am<br />
5 moderately bright stars and 2 faint stars within an area measuring 5&#8242;. Some nebulosity can be seen around the brightest stars. Since that nebulosity seems to disappear entirely when using an O-III or UHC filter, it probably is a reflection nebula associated with this young cluster.</p>
<p><b>NGC 7139</b> PN Cep 21 46 28 +63 50 21 13.5 2010-07-12 02:45am<br />
Faint, round and uniform nebulosity about 1&#8242; in diameter. A moderately faint (mag.. 14.4) lies just outside the nebula in the SSE direction.</p>

Roughly 40 stars, most of which are fairly bright, within an area 10&#8242; in diameter. This cluster is embedded inside M8, the famous Lagoon Nebula, and is likely physically related. There is a tight double on the eastern side.</p>
<p><b>NGC 6546</b> OC Sgr 18 08 03 -23 17 42 8.2 2010-07-12 11:10pm<br />
Seen as a faint smudge in 9&#215;50 finder scope. Fairly inconspicuous, round, measuring about 15&#8242; in diameter, this cluster contains two dozen moderately bright stars and at least as many faint stars over a milky background. There is a tight double at the western end.</p>
<p><b>IC 4634</b> PN Oph 17 02 13 -21 50 30 12.0 2010-07-12 11:40pm<br />
Appears as an out of focus star, even at 305x. Blinks well using an O-III filter. Roundish, about 10&#8243; in diameter, extremely slightly elongated N-S, fairly bright and uniform. Possible sighting of an extremely faint envelope extending 25&#8243; in diameter (although this may just be scattering).</p>
<p><b>NGC 6548</b> GX Her 18 06 29 +18 35 23 12.7 2010-07-12 11:40pm<br />
Very faint round diffuse halo, about 1.5&#8242; in diameter. Moderately bright core 30&#8243;x20&#8243; elongated NNW-SSE &#8211; this galaxy appears to be a face on barred spiral. An extremely faint superimposed star is located 1&#8242; ESE, and another one is 1.2&#8242; ENE. Very faint NGC 6549 is visible in the same field of view.</p>

Fairly bright core measuring about 30&#8243;x20&#8243; elongated NE-SW. Faint halo extending 1&#8217;x40&#8243; in the same direction. Very faint superimposed star at the SW end of the halo. Moderately faint field star 30&#8243; N.</p>
<p><b>NGC 7026</b> (Cheeseburger Nebula) PN Cyg 21 06 42 +47 53 38 12.0 2010-07-13 02:05am<br />
Best seen at 610x (Nagler 5mm + Barlow 2x). Located 30&#8243; WSW of a moderately bright (mag. 9.6) star, this nebula is composed of 2 moderately bright lobes oriented NE-SW separated by a dark lane, hence the name of &#8220;Cheeseburger Nebula&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<p><b>NGC 7031</b> OC Cyg 21 07 35 +50 55 03 11.0 2010-07-13 02:30am<br />

Moderately faint, measuring about 45&#8243;, very slightly elongated NE-SW, gradually brighter towards its center. This elliptical galaxy is the brightest member of the cluster of galaxies Abell 2199. Many members of that cluster are visible in the same field of view.</p>
<p><b>NGC 6239</b> GX Her 16 50 27 +42 43 25 12.9 2010-07-13 10:50pm<br />
1&#8217;x30&#8243; E-W, moderately faint, gradually brighter towards its center. Using Tom Osypowski&#8217;s 30&#8243; F/3.3 telescope, this galaxy appears much bigger and brighter but fails to show additional details.</p>
<p><b>IC 4756</b> OC Ser 18 39 33 +05 27 39 5.4 2010-07-13 11:45pm<br />
Seen naked eye as a faint smudge! Using a Panoptic 27mm (65x, 1.2 deg TFOV), this cluster shows about 40 fairly bright stars in an area measuring roughly 30&#8242; in diameter. A group of stars near the center delimit an oval region measuring 8&#8217;x4&#8242; NE-SW that is almost devoid of stars. Half a dozen stars form a chain to the ENE. Finally, there is a small group of 6/7 stars to the WNW that seems to be a region of higher density in this cluster.</p>

			<p>A few of us went to the D.A.R.C. observatory last night, including Robert Jardine (aka &#8220;Joe Bob&#8221;), Al Smith and his wife Annie, Al Howard, Eric Zbinden, Daniel Stefanescu, and of course Dr Lee Hoglan and Dr Bob Caton.</p>
<p>Before it turned dark, Bob Caton organized a short lecture on Kuiper belt objects, some of which he had imaged from his home in Modesto. He also shared a few recent photographs of M101 he had taken from his private observatory, and talked about future plans for the D.A.R.C. observatory, including the installation of a 50&#8243; dobsonian telescope.</p>
<p>Observing conditions were pretty good. There was no wind, except maybe for the occasional light &#8220;refreshing&#8221; breeze. The seeing was rather mediocre. The dry air, coming from the north, allowed for good transparency (NELM: 6.6). In addition, it was warm enough that it felt comfortable to wear nothing more than a pair of shorts and a light long sleeve shirt.</p>
<p>I spent a couple of hours observing a dozen or so Herschel II objects in Libra and Bootes. Then, I moved on to some eye candy in the Summer milky way, using my newly acquired Lumicon O-III filter. Finally, I got to play with the JMI 16&#8243; binocular telescope. Pretty cool! By the way, I took a quick look at M13 and finally saw the propeller! (thank you, Richard Ozer, for pointing it out to me on a photograph last month!)</p>
<p>Joe Bob and I looked for comet McNaught using our binoculars around 2:30am, but we could not spot it (it was supposed to be right near M34, which was very easily visible in our binoculars in spite of its low elevation)</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>I went to Lake San Antonio on Tuesday, May 11, in order to wrap up the Herschel 400 list, which I have been working on for almost a year and a half. I was missing 15 targets, all of them in Virgo. To make the night worth the trip, I added a few interesting targets from the TAC Eye Candy list, which I had installed in SkyTools.</p>
<p>The conditions were actually pretty decent. The sky was perfectly clear and the transparency was good. It was a little windy early on, but it turned calm by 10pm. The seeing was average or slightly below average. The temperature dropped to 38F by 2am. There was very little humidity, and my paper charts and log paper remained pretty dry all night. I was the only person in the overflow parking lot, and I have to admit that it felt a little spooky at times&#8230;</p>
<p>After observing all the targets I had planned (around 1am), I decided to celebrate the completion of the Herschel 400 project by observing a few very bright targets (mostly Messier objects), and stared at the rising Summer Milky Way, trying to convince myself that warmer nights are in our near future&#8230;</p>
<p>Below is my log for the night. The entire Herschel 400 log can be found at:</p>

Located between two very bright (mag. 6.8 and 7.0) field stars separated by about 15&#8242;. Faint halo estimated to be 4&#8217;x1&#8242; NW-SE using averted vision (photographs show that it extends even further). Bright core, about 1&#8242; in diameter, slightly elongated NW-SE. Moderately bright (mag. 13.2) about 1&#8242; SSW of the core.</p>
<p><b>NGC 4535</b> (Lost Galaxy) GX Vir 12 34 53 +08 08 17 10.5 10:40pm<br />
Dim oval glow, roughly 5&#8217;x3&#8242; NNE-SSW. Appears relatively uniform at low power. A few superimposed stars give the galaxy a &#8220;powdery&#8221; appearance. A small (< 1' diameter) core is barely visible, with a stellar nucleus. At higher magnification, dark patches in the halo are visible, but with great difficulty.

<b>NGC 4783</b> GX Crv 12 55 11 -12 37 05 12.8 10:55pm<br />
Moderately bright round core, about 30&#8243; in diameter. Forms a very tight couple with NGC 4782, located less than 1&#8242; SSW (both galaxies actually share the same halo). A moderately faint superimposed star is visible 30&#8243; WSW.</p>
<p><b>NGC 4624</b> GX Vir 12 45 39 +02 59 46 11.5 11:10pm<br />

			<p>On Tuesday, April 6, I joined Marko, Rogelio, Hans Schulze and Paul Duncan at Dinosaur Point for a night of observing. Conditions were decent with fairly calm winds, average transparency and seeing, temps in the mid to low 40s and low humidity. Dew was not a problem at all, and my paper charts remained mostly dry. We got to observe Mercury shortly after sunset, but it didn&#8217;t show any detail due to the strong atmospheric refraction and horrible seeing at such low altitude. After that, I observed Herschel II objects in Leo and a few Herschel 400 objects in Virgo. Marko, who was busy imaging (traitor! :-), let me use his StarMaster 18&#8243; dobsonian. This thing is &#8230; sweet! It moves like butter, stays still while focusing, and I was amazed by how much brighter objects looked compared to when observed through my 12&#8243;. I can&#8217;t wait to resume work on my own 16&#8243; scope. Thanks again Marko!</p>
<p>Two days later, on Thursday, April 8, Rogelio and I met at Lake San Antonio. I passed him on Highway 101 shortly after leaving Salinas, and we followed each other from that point on. Conditions were pretty good, with an estimated NELM around 6.7 and average seeing. Humidity was rather high, and my paper charts and log paper were pretty soaked (although interestingly enough, it seemed to come in waves&#8230;). Rogelio was imaging and taking naps during exposures while I was busy observing Herschel II objects in UMa and Herschel 400 objects in Virgo. Among other things, I observed 3C 273, a quasar located in the constellation Virgo (the first quasar ever to be identified, it&#8217;s located about 2.5 billion light years away from us!). It was pretty cold (not sure how cold it got, but when I woke up in the morning, my car was clocking at 38F) and I had to bail out around 1:30am. I slept like a baby until about 7:30am. On my way out of the Lake San Antonio campgrounds, I was careful not to hit any bunnies or deers when I saw a herd of wild boars. Cool! I was back at work at 11am, with a big smile on my face. Now that&#8217;s some serious addiction to dark skies ;-)</p>

			<p><b>General</b></p>
<p>Mark Wagner, Richard Navarrete, Steve Gottlieb, Peter Natscher, Rogelio Bernal Andreo and I met with our host, Kevin Ritschel, at his ranch in Willow Springs on Saturday, March 13, 2010.</p>
<p><b>Conditions</b></p>
<p>By sunset, the wind had subsided. The transparency was about average. Seeing was a bit soft early on, but it improved to just about average later in the evening.</p>
<p><b>Highlights</b></p>
<p>The zodiacal band was very obvious, pointing straight up, all the way to the Pleiades. The spiral arms around M 81 were obvious on both sides, although one side is much easier than the other. M61 was showing a lot of structure, reminiscent of photographs I&#8217;ve seen of that galaxy. Steve showed me a beautifully complex and surprisingly bright Sharpless object (Sh2-311? I&#8217;m not sure) in his 18&#8243; Starmaster telescope. We also looked at a couple of galaxies showing intricate detail in Peter Natscher&#8217;s 24&#8243; Starmaster telescope. Finally, Richard showed me an easy Hickson group (which one?) in his equatorially mounted Obsession 18&#8243; telescope. With my Meade Lightbridge 12&#8243;, I observed mostly Herschel 400 objects in Cam, Mon, Pup, Pyx and Vir. Among those objects, N2403/N2404 and the group composed of N4216, N4222 and N4206 were spectacular.</p>
<p><b>Star Hopping Technique</b></p>
<p>When printing an observing list, I always sort the objects by their Uranometria page and then by right ascension. I also sort the Uranometria pages from West to East and from South to North. Additionally, as a convenience, I always try to choose my targets in order to minimize the number of Uranometria pages I&#8217;ll have to refer to. When I want to point the first object on a given Uranometria page, I start by locating a naked eye star on that page as close as possible to that object. I then point my scope to that star using a red dot finder. Once I&#8217;ve confirmed the orientation of the field of view, I can hop from object to object using my trusty Stellarvue 9&#215;50 RACI finder scope in only a few seconds! Once the finder scope cross hair indicates the suspected location for an object, I look in the eyepiece, and the target is right in the middle of the field of view. Star hopping can be faster, more accurate, more fun, more rewarding and a lot more silent than a Goto! But it does require a bit of preparation&#8230;</p>
<p><b>The Big Freeze</b></p>
<p>My dew control equipment worked flawlessly, which allowed me to observe until about 12:30am (a respectable 5 hour session&#8230;). Around that time, the cold was becoming unbearable. No one specific part of my body was especially cold, but I realized that I was not able to focus anymore for long periods of time. I decided to take shelter in my car and slept for a couple of hours. Around 3am, I was woken up by Rogelio&#8217;s car headlights. I then realized that I was extremely uncomfortable because of the cold, and I&#8217;d better do something about it. So I packed the rest of my equipment and left around 3:30am, with the car heater set to its maximum setting. It took me a good hour to warm up. I made a quick pit-stop in Gilroy and picked up some breakfast at the drive-thru of a fast food restaurant. Needless to say that under such circumstances, it tasted mighty good!</p>

			<p>Greg LaFlamme, George Feliz, Scott Baker, Rogelio Bernal Andreo, Al Howard and myself met up at Dinosaur Point last night. The transparency was just about average as predicted by the Clear Sky Clock. The seeing was quite soft early on, but it improved a bit to just about average as the night went on. The entire sky was clear and usable, except maybe for a few wispy clouds to the north. The wind was nonexistent. I did not think of getting a temperature reading during the night, but it was rather cold, causing me to bail out early. I eventually got about 5 hours of observing, and successfully tested new dew control equipment. Most of the objects I observed were bright targets from the Herschel 400 and Messier lists. One of the highlights of the night was seeing the spiral arms of M81 in Greg&#8217;s 22&#8243; scope, and later in my own 12&#8243; scope. We also counted a dozen members in the NGC 3158 group located in Leo Minor. When I left, Rogelio was doing &#8220;ass-trash photography&#8221; (those are his words&#8230;) while Al was acquiring data for his next APOD. All in all, a pretty good night! I&#8217;m now looking forward to this weekend, carrying the promise of even darker skies. Below is my log for the night. Cheers!</p>

<p><b>NGC 2335</b> OC Mon 07h07m19.6s -10°02&#8217;50&#8221; 9.3 mag 07:20p<br />
Barely visible in 9&#215;50 finder scope using averted vision as a small and very pale smudge. This cluster is composed of about 25 moderately bright to moderately faint stars, plus a few fainter ones coming in and out of view, appearing within an area 10&#8242; in diameter. The brightest star (mag 9.5), located near the center of the cluster, appears slightly orange.</p>
<p><b>NGC 2343</b> OC Mon 07h08m36.5s -10°38&#8217;10&#8221; 7.5 mag 07:25p<br />
Already noticeable in 9&#215;50 finder scope. Contains about 20 moderately bright stars within 6&#8242;. There is a tight double (J2782A/B) in the center of the cluster. A pretty double, which brighter component, to the east, appears orange, grazes the eastern edge of the cluster.</p>
<p><b>NGC 2353</b> OC Mon 07h15m00.6s -10°17&#8217;15&#8221; 5.2 mag 07:35p<br />
Barely visible in 9&#215;50 finder scope. About 40 moderately bright to faint stars scattered within an area 12&#8217;x10&#8242; WNW-ESE. A very bright star (mag 6.0) is located at the SW boundary. Hipparcos data seems to show that the brighter stars in this cluster are superimposed field stars (the cluster supposedly being 3,600 ly away from us) which would explain the large brightness distribution.</p>
<p><b>M 47</b> OC Pup 07h37m04.8s -14°30&#8217;35&#8221; 4.3 mag 07:50p<br />
Easily seen in 9&#215;50 finder scope, along with nearby M46. Composed of about 80 bright to moderately faint stars scattered within 25&#8242;. Nice appparent double in the center, with components of similar brightness (mag 6.9 and 7.3). Small and faint cluster NGC 2425 spotted just 30&#8242; SE.</p>
<p><b>NGC 2423</b> OC Pup 07h37m35.9s -13°53&#8217;53&#8221; 7.0 mag 08:00p<br />
Located about 1° N of much brighter M47. Composed of about 50 stars of similar magnitude scattered within an area 12&#8242; in diameter. Nice apparent double star near the center.</p>
<p><b>NGC 2438</b> PN Pup 07h42m21.2s -14°45&#8217;34&#8221; 11.0 mag 08:05p<br />
This planetary nebula is embedded inside open cluster M46, providing a striking view at 95x. Fairly bright and round, about 1&#8242; in diameter. A moderately bright star is located just 15&#8243; SE. At 217x, two faint superimposed stars can be seen, the brighter one being located 5&#8243; NW of the center, while the dimmer one is about 5&#8243; W of the center. Using a UHC filter, the nebula shows up as a ring. The marginally darker inner region is about 30&#8243; in diameter. The eastern portion of the rim seems slightly brighter.</p>
<p><b>NGC 1444</b> OC Per 03h50m12.0s +52°41&#8217;36&#8221; 6.4 mag 08:30p<br />
A bright double star (Struve 446), which components are roughly E-W, separated by 15&#8243;, the brighter component being to the E (mag 6.7 and 6.8) is at the heart of this very poor cluster. A line of 4 evenly spaced moderately faint stars starts about 1&#8242; NW and ends 1.5&#8242; W of the double star aforementioned. 6 additional faint stars can be spotted within an area 5&#8242; in diameter. This object is marked as a double star in Uranometria 2nd edition (?)</p>
<p><b>NGC 2489</b> OC Pup 07h56m41.1s -30°05&#8217;42&#8221; 9.3 mag 08:40p<br />
This cluster is composed of about 3 dozen faint to moderately faint stars, fairly evenly scattered within an area 6&#8242; in diameter. The bright orange PX Pup is located just 25&#8242; S. Also, another cluster, named Haf 20, located about 30&#8242; S, was barely detected.</p>
<p><b>NGC 2567</b> OC Pup 08h18m58.5s -30°40&#8217;35&#8221; 8.4 mag 08:55p<br />
Detected in 9&#215;50 finder scope. This cluster is composed of about 3 dozen moderately faint stars scattered within an area 10&#8217;x5&#8242; WSW-ENE. 6 stars form a 5&#8242; long chain almost N-S located in the middle of the cluster.</p>
<p><b>NGC 2571</b> OC Pup 08h19m22.7s -29°47&#8217;11&#8221; 7.4 mag 09:00p<br />
About 20 moderately bright to moderately faint stars scattered within an area 6&#8217;x3&#8242; WSW-ENE, surrounded by a ring almost devoid of stars about 4&#8242; thick.</p>
<p><b>NGC 2627</b> OC Pyx 08h37m42.2s -29°59&#8217;42&#8221; 8.4 mag 09:05p<br />
About 2 dozen moderately faint stars over a milky background that seems to be composed of many faint stars, some of which coming in and out view as I looked around, within 6&#8242;. The southern edge of this cluster seems to be delimited by a region almost devoid of stars elongated E-W and 6&#8242; wide, with a few more stars just south of it.</p>
<p><b>NGC 3003</b> GX LMi 09h49m14.5s +33°22&#8217;20&#8221; 12.2 mag 10:00p<br />
Moderately faint, 4&#8217;x1&#8242; WSW-ENE, brighter core roughly 1.5&#8217;x45&#8243;.</p>

			<p>I decided to take advantage of a break in the weather and headed to Henry Coe state park. There, I found Jeff Weiss and Paul Duncan. Rogelio joined us a short while later, followed by Mark Johnston and his family. Even though it had rained the day before, the overflow parking lot was not as muddy as I had feared. The wind was a bit strong early on, but died down around 8pm. The temperature stabilized in the low 40s. Transparency and seeing were both slightly below average. At times, clouds covered almost the entire sky, only to retreat a few minutes later. My observing list was composed of bright targets, mostly from the Herschel 400 project, and mostly to the East or near the Zenith. I was able to observe until about 9:30pm. Around that time, dew really became a problem. Since I have absolutely no anti-dew equipment, it meant that it was time for me to pack and go home. However, before leaving, using Paul&#8217;s (dry) eyepieces, we were able to get half-decent views of Mars, and easily saw Syrtis Major, Utopia Planitia and the north polar cap. Overall, it was a fairly pleasant evening.</p>
<p>Location: Henry Coe state park [Elevation 2600 ft]<br />
Telescope: Meade Lightbridge 12&#8243; F/5<br />
Eyepieces used:<br />
&#8211; Televue Panoptic 27mm (56x – 1.2° TFOV)<br />
&#8211; Televue Nagler 16mm type 5 (95x – 52&#8242; TFOV)<br />
&#8211; Televue Nagler 9mm type 6 (169x – 29&#8242; TFOV)<br />
&#8211; Televue Nagler 7mm type 6 (217x – 22&#8242; TFOV)<br />
&#8211; Televue Nagler 5mm type 6 (305x – 16&#8242; TFOV)<br />
(All times are PST)</p>
<p><b>NGC 1027</b> OC Cas 02h43m29.3s +61°38&#8217;37&#8221; 7.4 mag 06:50pm<br />
About 40 fairly bright to moderately bright stars within an area 20&#8242; wide, centered on a bright (mag 7) yellowish (?) star.</p>
<p><b>NGC 650</b> (M76 &#8211; Little Dumbbell) PN Per 01h42m59.4s +51°37&#8217;54&#8221; 10.1 mag 07:00pm<br />
At low magnifications, this nebula appears bright, rectangular, 2&#8217;x1&#8242; elongated NE-SW. At higher magnifications, it appears to be composed of two oval lobes, each being slightly elongated NW-SE, and separated by a &#8220;bridge&#8221; of slightly lower surface brightness. The lobe to the SW is the brighter of the two, and a faint star appears at its southern edge. A UHC filter reveals faint extensions to the SE and the NW (the SE extension being easier to detect).</p>
<p><b>NGC 869</b> (h Persei) OC Per 02h19m44.5s +57°10&#8217;49&#8221; 4.3 mag 07:20pm<br />
Striking at low power, when nearby NGC 884 appears in the same field of view. Composed of 100+ bright stars scattered within a 8&#8242; wide area, with a few additional stars to the NW. Two very bright yellowish stars (mag 6.7 and 7.1) stand out near the center.</p>
<p><b>NGC 884</b> (Chi Persei) OC Per 02h23m02.8s +57°11&#8217;18&#8221; 4.4 mag 07:30pm<br />
Striking at low power, when nearby NGC 869 appears in the same field of view. Composed of 100+ bright stars scattered within an area 15&#8242; in diameter. A few orange stars can be spotted in and around the cluster, the most impressive of which is FZ Per (mag 8.0), located about 10&#8242; WNW of the cluster center region.</p>
<p><b>NGC 1501</b> PN Cam 04h07m54.7s +60°57&#8217;07&#8221; 12.0 mag 07:55pm<br />
Moderately bright and almost round, very slightly elongated E-W, about 1&#8242; in diameter. Very slightly darker in the center. The northern and southern portions of the rim appear very slightly brighter. Moderately faint (mag 14.4) central star easily visible when not using a narrowband filter. This nebula is also known as the (Blue) Oyster Nebula.</p>
<p><b>NGC 1502</b> OC Cam 04h08m47.0s +62°21&#8217;46&#8221; 4.1 mag 08:05pm<br />
Located at the southeast end of a popular asterism known as &#8220;Kemble&#8217;s Cascade&#8221;. About 40 moderately bright to very bright stars within an area roughly 7&#8242; in diameter, centered on a close pair of bright yellow stars (Struve 485)</p>
<p><b>NGC 1535</b> (Cleopatra&#8217;s Eye) PN Eri 04h14m45.8s -12°42&#8217;54&#8221; 9.4 mag 08:45pm<br />
Bright, round, about 15&#8243; in diameter, surrounded by a fainter round envelope about 25&#8243; in diameter. The central star was easily seen when not using a UHC filter. The region just around the central star looks slightly darker, although this may be a visual artifact (a DSS image shows that it is indeed real). The nebula shows a very light tinge of blue at low magnifications.</p>
<p><b>NGC 1664</b> OC Aur 04h51m52.0s +43°41&#8217;41&#8221; 7.2 mag 09:10pm<br />
About 30 moderately bright stars within an area 10&#8242; in diameter. One of the stars (HN Aur) appears prominently red on photographs, but I did not notice it. Since it is a variable star, its redness may vary over time. Some people find that this cluster appears to draw the shape of a kite, which is why it is often nicknamed the &#8220;Kite Cluster&#8221;. Others have seen the leaf of a clover (Walter Scott Houston). I personally see the shape of a heart. The string of stars to the SSE forms the string of a heart shaped helium balloon&#8230;</p>
<p><b>NGC 1857</b> OC Aur 05h20m50.6s +39°21&#8217;19&#8221; 8.4 mag 09:30pm<br />
About two dozen fairly faint to moderately bright stars scattered within an area 10&#8242; in diameter centered on a bright (mag 7.4) orange star.</p>
<p><b>NGC 1245</b> OC Per 03h15m26.0s +47°16&#8217;42&#8221; 7.7 mag 09:45pm<br />
Roughly 60 moderately faint stars spread fairly evenly over an 8&#8242; wide area, except for a couple of small regions nearly devoid of stars near the center of the cluster. Bright (mag 8.0) star about 5&#8242; SSE.</p>
