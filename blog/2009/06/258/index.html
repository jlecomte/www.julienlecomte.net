			<p>I had decided to spend the night of Friday, June 19 in Redding, at the Best Western Hilltop Inn, in order to arrive rested in Adin on Saturday. On Friday night, I enjoyed a nice dinner with David Cooper, who was also staying at the same hotel.</p>
<p>The short drive to Adin on Saturday morning was uneventful, and I arrived at the camp site around noon, promptly setting up my tent on Uranus row. Since the weather outlook was not looking very promising at the time, I made the decision to leave my scope in the car. This turned out to be a smart move because Saturday night was wild, with lightning, heavy rain, and even hail! My small tent handled the elements remarkably well, and I remained dry all night, unlike a few others&#8230;</p>
<p>On Sunday afternoon, Rogelio, David and I visited the Lava Beds National Monument. This was a fun outing, although it was a fairly long drive (3 hours round trip from Adin) During the day, the weather forecast gradually improved, and the sky turned mostly clear after sunset. Because of a few high altitude clouds, the sky that night was not nearly as dark as it could have been. I got NELM 6.7 in Hercules.</p>
<p>Monday night was slightly better. Alvin and I both got NELM 6.9. This was still a bit disappointing. Under such dark skies, when the conditions are ideal, one can get NELM 7.5. Tuesday night was probably the best one. After a really hot day, I got NELM 7.0 in Hercules. The milky way looked absolutely gorgeous, all the way down to the southern horizon. The seeing was about average on all three nights, although it felt a little more solid on the last night.</p>
<p>I had put together a list of about 60 objects, most of which from the Herschel 400, containing mostly galaxies, nebulae and globular clusters. I did not want to observe too many open clusters from such a dark site, because those can be observed under less than ideal skies from the bay area. I ended up observing about 40 of those objects, leaving enough time for some free-style eye candy that I did not log. Some of the highlights include observing the central star in M57, as well as the nearby IC 1296 galaxy in Alvin Huey&#8217;s 22&#8243; scope. The crescent nebula was also putting on quite a show through my scope using an OIII filter. Finally, seeing both arches of the veil nebula in one field of view through David&#8217;s 80mm refractor was really amazing!</p>
<p>This was my first out of town multi-day star party, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Most of all, it was really great to finally meet a lot of TACos in person. The food cattered by our host, the owners of the Frosty Acres ranch, was absolutely delicious. The shower truck was awesome! A big thank you to the GSSP organizing committee for putting together the star party, and to David Cooper, who shared his canopy, and saved me from getting burnt by the Sun&#8230;</p>

Fairly large, moderately bright edge-on galaxy. Elongated roughly 10&#215;1 NNW-SSE. Weak central concentration/bulge. Hints of a dark lane at 217x. Eastern half of the bulge appears brighter. Fairly faint star (14.5 mag) about 1&#8242; WSW of bulge. Reminiscent of NGC 4565, although not as impressive.</p>
<p><b>NGC 5982</b> GX Dra 15h38m54.3s +59°19&#8217;35&#8221; 12.0 mag 11:35p<br />
Small, fairly bright, with a relatively large core surrounded by a halo slightly elongated E-W. Forms a beautiful trio with NGC 5981 and NGC 5985. The members of this group show obvious differences in morphology.</p>
<p><b>NGC 6451</b> (Tom Thumb Cluster) OC Sco 17h51m20.2s -30°12&#8217;48&#8221; 8.2 mag 12:05a<br />
Fairly small, composed of about 30 moderately bright stars. Overall shape reminds me of an arrowhead. A large dark lane splits this cluster in the N-S direction.</p>
<p><b>NGC 6755</b> OC Aql 19h08m19.4s +04°16&#8217;53&#8221; 8.6 mag 12:35a<br />
About 30 fairly bright stars scattered within 15&#8242;. Irregular shape, several dark lanes. Located about 40&#8242; SSE of NGC 6756.</p>
<p><b>NGC 6756</b> OC Aql 19h09m12.3s +04°43&#8217;12&#8221; 10.6 mag 12:35a<br />
Very compact group of relatively faint stars (could not get a reliable star count) surrounded by a darker ring and a few moderately bright stars.</p>
<p><b>NGC 6826</b> (Blinking Planetary) PN Cyg 19h45m05.7s +50°32&#8217;47&#8221; 8.8 mag 01:10a<br />
Small, very bright, roundish, very slightly elongated WNW-ESE. Blue/green color seen at 169x. Fairly bright central star. Blinking effect noticed easily. OIII filter shows hints of an extremely faint outer shell (?)</p>
<p><b>NGC 6946</b> GX Cyg 20h35m06.8s +60°11&#8217;02&#8221; 9.8 mag 01:25a<br />
Fairly large galaxy with a relatively low surface brightness, elongated 3:2 E-W. Very weak, moderately large central concentration. Two spiral arms seen pretty easily E and W of the core. Situated in a rich star field. Forms a superb couple with open cluster NGC 6939. Both objects can be seen within the 1.2 degree field of view of the Panoptic 27mm.</p>
<p><b>NGC 7008</b> PN Cyg 21h00m51.0s +54°34&#8217;41&#8221; 12.0 mag 01:40a<br />
Relatively large and pretty bright planetary nebula. Appears elongated 2&#215;1 N-S at low power. Using a higher magnification and an OIII filter, I can see 2 lobes positioned on a N-S line, the one to the north being the bigger and brighter one. Without the narrow band filter, the central star was easily detected, as well as a superimposed star to the ENE and 2 fairly bright stars located SE of the nebula. This object is also called the Fetus Nebula.</p>
<p><b>NGC 6905</b> PN Del 20h22m50.2s +20°08&#8217;04&#8221; 12.0 mag 01:55a<br />
Fairly small, moderately bright, almost round, very slightly elongated N-S. The disk is not perfectly uniform. The eastern portion of the nebula is brighter, while the southern and especially the northern regions are slightly darker. Fairly faint central star.</p>
<p><b>NGC 6118</b> GX Ser 16h22m20.2s -02°18&#8217;27&#8221; 12.4 mag 02:05a<br />
Moderately large, very low surface brightness, elongated 2&#215;1 almost E-W, very uniform. Extremely weak central concentration detected at 169x. Fairly faint (15.2 mag) superimposed star located about 2&#8242; E of the core.</p>
<h3>June 23, 2009</h3>
<p><b>NGC 5466</b> GC  Boö 14h05m54.2s +28°29&#8217;25&#8221; 9.2 mag 10:30p<br />
Detected in 9&#215;50 finder scope. Fairly large. Fairly uniform low surface brightness. Brighter stars resolved at 95x. A few more stars visible at 169x. Appears irregular in shape.</p>
<p><b>NGC 6171</b> (M 107) GC Oph 16h33m06.1s -13°04&#8217;30&#8221; 7.8 mag 10:40p<br />

<p><b>NGC 6273</b> (M 19) GC Oph 17h03m15.7s -26°17&#8217;01&#8221; 6.8 mag 11:05p<br />
Spotted in 9&#215;50 finder scope while looking for NGC 6284. Pretty large and bright, low surface brightness gradient. A large number of stars are resolved throughout at higher magnification.</p>
<p><b>NGC 6293</b> GC Oph 17h10m47.9s -26°35&#8217;42&#8221; 8.3 mag 11:10p<br />
Pretty small, moderately bright, intense core, outer region partially resolved at 219x.</p>
<p><b>NGC 6287</b> GC Oph 17h05m45.7s -22°43&#8217;22&#8221; 9.3 mag 11:15p<br />
Pretty small and faint, relatively uniform, located at the southern edge of a region devoid of stars (B51/B47 dark nebulae?) Takes on a powdery appearance at 219x, especially its eastern region, with a few stars coming in and out of view.</p>
<p><b>NGC 6304</b> GC Oph 17h15m10.8s -29°28&#8217;27&#8221; 8.3 mag 11:20p<br />
Pretty small, moderately bright, relatively uniform, unresolved at 219x, powdery appearance.</p>
<p><b>NGC 6316</b> GC Oph 17h17m15.4s -28°09&#8217;07&#8221; 8.1 mag 11:25p<br />
Very small, moderately bright, broad central concentration, unresolved. Located 1&#8242; WNW of a fairly bright (mag 11.4) star and 1&#8242; E of a slightly fainter (mag 12.3) star.</p>
<p><b>NGC 6342</b> GC Oph 17h21m46.0s -19°35&#8217;50&#8221; 9.5 mag 11:30p<br />
Very small, fairly faint, relatively bright core, unresolved. Located just 1&#8242; NNE of a moderately bright (mag 12) star, and just south of B259.</p>
<p><b>NGC 6356</b> GC Oph 17h24m10.6s -17°49&#8217;24&#8221; 8.2 mag 11:35p<br />
Moderately large and bright, relatively bright core, unresolved (this object was low over the horizon when I observed it, so the bad seeing didn&#8217;t help)</p>
<p><b>NGC 6355</b> GC Oph 17h24m35.9s -26°21&#8217;48&#8221; 8.6 mag 11:40p<br />
Very small, pretty faint, relatively uniform, unresolved, apparently located behind a dark cloud.</p>
<p><b>NGC 6144</b> GC  Sco 16h27m51.2s -26°02&#8217;42&#8221; 9.0 mag 11:45p<br />
Small, faint, right near Antares and M4. At 217x, about a dozen or so brighter stars are resolved over a milky background. Both M4 and NGC 6144 fit in the same 1.2 degree field of view generated by the Panoptic 27mm.</p>
<p><b>NGC 6369</b> (Little Ghost Nebula) PN Oph 17h29m57.6s -23°46&#8217;05&#8221; 11.0 mag 11:50p<br />
Pretty small, pretty faint, round, uniform, looks like an out of focus star at 95x. Delicate ring structure suspected, confirmed at 219x using a UHC filter. I did not see the central star. Northern rim looks very slightly brighter. Reminiscent of M57, but much smaller.</p>
<p><b>NGC 6401</b> GC Oph 17h39m14.3s -23°54&#8217;59&#8221; 7.4 mag 12:00a<br />
Small, pretty faint, almost completely uniform. Moderately bright (mag 12) superimposed star very slightly off center toward ESE.</p>
<p><b>NGC 6426</b> GC Oph 17h45m24.7s +03°09&#8217;56&#8221; 10.9 mag 12:10a<br />
Fairly small, surprisingly faint and uniform. Very weak central concentration. A few very faint stars pop in and out of view around the edge of the halo.</p>
<p><b>NGC 6517</b> GC Oph 18h02m24.5s -08°57&#8217;32&#8221; 10.1 mag 12:15a<br />
Small, fairly faint, small and relatively bright core, unresolved.</p>
<p><b>NGC 6633</b> OC Oph 18h27m44.9s +06°30&#8217;49&#8221; 5.6 mag 12:20a<br />
Best seen at low power (Panoptic 27mm) Easily spotted in 9&#215;50 finder scope. About 30 bright stars of comparable brightness, along with many fainter stars, are scattered within about 25&#8242;.</p>
