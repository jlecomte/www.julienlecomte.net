		<description><![CDATA[Julien- thanks....I certainly haven&#039;t worked up to a Federal card table.  I have attended a couple of classes at the Philadelphia Furniture Workshop with Mario - what a great guy and a great teacher.  You should come this way sometime for one and we&#039;ll connect - Philly is a great food town and lots of furniture history....]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey, Rusty! Good to hear from you :) I have not picked the veneer yet. I will probably follow Mario Rodriguez advice and do all the veneering work on a flat surface, resaw and then glue to the apron. I also need to come up with a design for the marquetry that will be on the apron... As I told you back at FWW Live, this project is going to keep me busy for a very long time! :) The next step is to dovetail the back of the apron. Cheers! Julien (PS: I checked out your site, you&#039;ve got a lot of nice pieces there!)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Julien- nicely done and great explanation!  Looks like we have a similar setup - I&#039;ve got a popup Ridgid tablesaw and a Grizzley 555x bandsaw - in my garage....do you have the veneer yet or will you be making it?  Rusty]]></description>
