		<description><![CDATA[FF 2.0.0.11 under Ubuntu 7.10 Gnome 2.20.1 and it performs the same way using the new version of GMail.  @Julien closing the GMail tab does cause FF to freeze for 5+ seconds.  In this release, I think they&#039;re trying to pull back less data by using JSON and have the client&#039;s browser build everything.  Every time GMail queries for new data, it seems to redisplay the starred and status images.  It&#039;s definitely slower than the older version but it comes packed with more features.]]></description>

Maybe they haven&#039;t moved you to the new version yet.

I still manage to freeze the entire browser for about 10 seconds every time I close the tab that&#039;s currently running Gmail. Every so often, this same action causes Firefox to crash. I cannot reproduce any of these problems with the older version of Gmail.

Also, the interface is a bit more sluggish than the older version (especially switching to a folder I haven&#039;t visited since the beginning of a session)

If a Gmail developer happens to read this, I am using Firefox 2.0.0.9. I disabled Firebug and turned the chat feature off.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have had no troubles; I do however find yahoo mail to be far and away inferior to gmail.

   1)  Gmail less ads 
   2)  Superior handling of attachments
   3)  Awesome spam protection - virus pro seems good too
