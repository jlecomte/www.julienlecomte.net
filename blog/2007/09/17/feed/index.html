		<description><![CDATA[Nice pictures. I&#039;ve only just started astronomy as a hobby, with an Orion XT10i Intelliscope. Its a Newtonian Reflector on a Dobsonian base, which I am starting to discover makes astrophotography a little difficult since it does not have motors to enable equatorial tracking. 

Still I am able to take some photos and use K3CCDTools to take AVI&#039;s and Registax to stack the frames and improve the photos. They are not bad results, but your photos of Mars and Jupiter are very nice, some good detail in Mars particularly, which I understand can be a bit difficult to photograph. 

I too use a webcam, a Phillips SPC900NC which is a similar spec and sensitivity to your Toucam, except I think mine allows the modification for the Steve Chambers &quot;long exposure&quot; mod to be made even easier, due to a redesign of the circuit board which brings the required connections away from the chips which are so tiny it makes soldering to them difficult on the Toucam. I have yet to make the SC LX mod, but I chose this webcam because of the ease of doing it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Would be interested in the details of how you managed to get great pictures with your telescope.  I have the same scope, very happy with it but would like to move into picture taking so I can share my cold nights results with others.  What lens did you use, what camera, any software, etc.

Thank you for your time and sharing the photos.
