			<p><b>General</b></p>
<p>Mark Wagner, Richard Navarrete, Steve Gottlieb, Peter Natscher, Rogelio Bernal Andreo and I met with our host, Kevin Ritschel, at his ranch in Willow Springs on Saturday, March 13, 2010.</p>
<p><b>Conditions</b></p>
<p>By sunset, the wind had subsided. The transparency was about average. Seeing was a bit soft early on, but it improved to just about average later in the evening.</p>
<p><b>Highlights</b></p>
<p>The zodiacal band was very obvious, pointing straight up, all the way to the Pleiades. The spiral arms around M 81 were obvious on both sides, although one side is much easier than the other. M61 was showing a lot of structure, reminiscent of photographs I&#8217;ve seen of that galaxy. Steve showed me a beautifully complex and surprisingly bright Sharpless object (Sh2-311? I&#8217;m not sure) in his 18&#8243; Starmaster telescope. We also looked at a couple of galaxies showing intricate detail in Peter Natscher&#8217;s 24&#8243; Starmaster telescope. Finally, Richard showed me an easy Hickson group (which one?) in his equatorially mounted Obsession 18&#8243; telescope. With my Meade Lightbridge 12&#8243;, I observed mostly Herschel 400 objects in Cam, Mon, Pup, Pyx and Vir. Among those objects, N2403/N2404 and the group composed of N4216, N4222 and N4206 were spectacular.</p>
<p><b>Star Hopping Technique</b></p>
<p>When printing an observing list, I always sort the objects by their Uranometria page and then by right ascension. I also sort the Uranometria pages from West to East and from South to North. Additionally, as a convenience, I always try to choose my targets in order to minimize the number of Uranometria pages I&#8217;ll have to refer to. When I want to point the first object on a given Uranometria page, I start by locating a naked eye star on that page as close as possible to that object. I then point my scope to that star using a red dot finder. Once I&#8217;ve confirmed the orientation of the field of view, I can hop from object to object using my trusty Stellarvue 9&#215;50 RACI finder scope in only a few seconds! Once the finder scope cross hair indicates the suspected location for an object, I look in the eyepiece, and the target is right in the middle of the field of view. Star hopping can be faster, more accurate, more fun, more rewarding and a lot more silent than a Goto! But it does require a bit of preparation&#8230;</p>
<p><b>The Big Freeze</b></p>
<p>My dew control equipment worked flawlessly, which allowed me to observe until about 12:30am (a respectable 5 hour session&#8230;). Around that time, the cold was becoming unbearable. No one specific part of my body was especially cold, but I realized that I was not able to focus anymore for long periods of time. I decided to take shelter in my car and slept for a couple of hours. Around 3am, I was woken up by Rogelio&#8217;s car headlights. I then realized that I was extremely uncomfortable because of the cold, and I&#8217;d better do something about it. So I packed the rest of my equipment and left around 3:30am, with the car heater set to its maximum setting. It took me a good hour to warm up. I made a quick pit-stop in Gilroy and picked up some breakfast at the drive-thru of a fast food restaurant. Needless to say that under such circumstances, it tasted mighty good!</p>
<p><b>Acknowledgments</b></p>
<p>Big thanks to our host Kevin Ritschel. I&#8217;m hoping to visit the Deep Sky Ranch again next month!</p>

Very faint extensions seem to extend 6&#8217;x3.5&#8242; WNW-SSE when observed at low power using averted vision. The HII region NGC 2404 appears as a small round moderately bright knot about 1.5&#8242; ENE of the core. Many superimposed stars are visible.</p>
