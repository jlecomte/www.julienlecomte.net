			<p>Jim Harper, Stephen Migol and I met up around sunset at the overflow parking lot at Henry Coe state park. I had a pretty bad experience last time I went to Coe, back in January. However, this time around, the transparency was above average and we got some very decent skies. I did a zenithal NELM test in Lyra, and reached mag 6.2, which is not too bad given the amount of light pollution&#8230; The seeing was very soft early on, but slightly improved as the night went on. Temps were in the 60s. There was a fairly strong breeze all night long, which was a bit of a problem for my very lightweight dobsonian telescope. However, by using my car as a shield, I was able to somewhat mitigate the impact of wind gusts.</p>
<p>Henry Coe is the perfect location to get a lot of boring open clusters out of the way, or to do some narrow-banding. I worked in Sagittarius all night, and got some pretty decent views in spite of the light pollution emanating from Gilroy. I took off right around 1am, and was soundly asleep by 2&#8230; I&#8217;m not used to that anymore! Overall, a fairly decent night. See my log below. Cheers!</p>

<p><b>NGC 6569</b> GC Sgr 18h14m17.9s -31°49&#8217;29&#8221; 8.4 mag 09:55p<br />
Moderately small and faint, relatively uniform. The halo takes on a grainy appearance at 219x. Located about 45&#8242; E of smaller and fainter globular cluster NGC 6558, giving a nice comparison.</p>
<p><b>NGC 6624</b> GC Sgr 18h24m19.5s -30°21&#8217;14&#8221; 7.6 mag 10:00p<br />
Moderately small and fairly bright. Small intense core. Halo resolves in a great number of faint stars during brief moments of better seeing.</p>
<p><b>NGC 6520</b> OC Sgr 18h04m02.7s -27°53&#8217;20&#8221; 7.6 mag 10:25p<br />
The central region of this open cluster is made up of about 20 fairly bright stars, seemingly arranged in a circle of about 1.5&#8242; in diameter around a pretty bright star with a distinctive orange tinge. A few bright stars are scattered around this area within 8&#8242;. Best seen at low power. Amazing contrast with Barnard 86 (a.k.a. the &#8220;ink spot&#8221;) located just to the west. I&#8217;m wondering whether B86 is located in front of or behind NGC 6520.</p>
<p><b>NGC 6540</b> OC Sgr 18h06m59.6s -27°47&#8217;38&#8221; 14.6 mag 10:30p<br />
Barely noticeable as a faint and tiny (1&#8242;) very unimpressive smudge elongated 2&#215;1 E-W. About half a dozen stars are resolved at 219x. PSA says it&#8217;s a globular cluster, but it does not look like one and ST mentions it as an open cluster&#8230;</p>
<p><b>NGC 6553</b> GC Sgr 18h09m55.1s -25°54&#8217;26&#8221; 8.3 mag 10:40p<br />
Moderately large, relatively low surface brightness, surprisingly uniform with no obvious core! Appears very slightly elongated NW-SE? Fairly bright (mag 11.8) superimposed star on the NW side. Generally unresolved, very slight grainy appearance maybe? A few stars pop in and out of view during brief moments of better seeing (not sure whether these are actually part of the globular cluster)</p>
<p><b>NGC 6544</b> GC Sgr 18h07m57.8s -24°59&#8217;52&#8221; 7.5 mag 10:45p<br />
Small (about 1&#8242;), moderately bright with a tiny fairly bright core. About a dozen brighter stars are resolved at higher magnification. Surrounded by numerous moderately bright field stars. Both NGC 6544 and M8 should fit within the same field of view of the Panoptic 27, forming an interesting couple, although I did not think of observing both of these objects at once.</p>
<p><b>NGC 6514</b> (M 20) OC Sgr 18h03m19.2s -22°58&#8217;20&#8221; 5.2 mag 11:10p<br />
Fairly large (about 10&#8242;), bright, detected in the finder scope. Absolutely gorgeous at lower magnification with a UHC filter. The dark lanes that split this object in 3 lobes are very well defined. There is a double star in the middle of the nebula. Another nebula, about the same size, is visible, although fainter, slightly to the north.</p>
<p><b>NGC 6440</b> GC Sgr 17h49m29.5s -20°21&#8217;49&#8221; 9.3 mag 11:15p<br />
Pretty small (1&#8242;), moderately faint, moderately well defined core, unresolved. Forms a really beautiful couple with planetary nebula NGC 6445 located about 22&#8242; NNE.</p>
<p><b>NGC 6445</b> PN Sgr 17h49m51.5s -20°00&#8217;47&#8221; 13.0 mag 11:25p<br />
Pretty small (about 40&#8243;), fairly bright, easily found even at low magnification (95x) Forms a really beautiful couple with globular cluster NGC 6440 located about 22&#8242; SSW. At 219x with a UHC filter, appears as a ring very slightly elongated 4:3 NNW-SSE. Brighter arches on the NNW and SSE sides. No central star seen. Moderately faint (mag 12.5) star just 30&#8243; WNW.</p>
<p><b>NGC 6568</b> OC Sgr 18h13m20.9s -21°36&#8217;10&#8221; 8.6 mag 11:40p<br />
Best seen at low magnification. About 50 moderately bright stars of comparable magnitude, scattered evenly within an area 20&#8242; in diameter. At higher magnification, the stars appear to be forming &#8220;chain structures&#8221; surrounded by darker regions.</p>
<p><b>NGC 6583</b> OC Sgr 18h16m26.0s -22°08&#8217;02&#8221; 10.0 mag 11:45p<br />
Compact group made of about 2 dozen stars. Pretty faint, barely noticeable in a crowded star field.</p>
<p><b>NGC 6629</b> PN Sgr 18h26m19.8s -23°11&#8217;52&#8221; 10.5 mag 12:00a<br />
Careful star hopping is required to found this planetary nebula as it appears almost stellar, especially in below average seeing. Pretty bright, round.</p>
<p><b>NGC 6642</b> GC Sgr 18h32m31.4s -23°28&#8217;06&#8221; 8.9 mag 12:10a<br />
Small, moderately bright, tiny fairly bright core, halo partially resolved at higher magnification.</p>
<p><b>NGC 6638</b> GC Sgr 18h31m34.0s -25°29&#8217;25&#8221; 9.2 mag 12:15a<br />
Fairly small, moderately bright, comparatively large core. The halo takes on a grainy appearance during brief moments of better seeing.</p>
<p><b>NGC 6645</b> OC Sgr 18h33m12.6s -16°52&#8217;34&#8221; 8.5 mag 12:20a<br />
About 50 stars spread within an area roughly 15&#8242; in diameter. Spotted in 9&#215;50 finder scope. Curious oval dark region almost in the middle of the cluster.</p>

			<p>I had decided to spend the night of Friday, June 19 in Redding, at the Best Western Hilltop Inn, in order to arrive rested in Adin on Saturday. On Friday night, I enjoyed a nice dinner with David Cooper, who was also staying at the same hotel.</p>
<p>The short drive to Adin on Saturday morning was uneventful, and I arrived at the camp site around noon, promptly setting up my tent on Uranus row. Since the weather outlook was not looking very promising at the time, I made the decision to leave my scope in the car. This turned out to be a smart move because Saturday night was wild, with lightning, heavy rain, and even hail! My small tent handled the elements remarkably well, and I remained dry all night, unlike a few others&#8230;</p>
<p>On Sunday afternoon, Rogelio, David and I visited the Lava Beds National Monument. This was a fun outing, although it was a fairly long drive (3 hours round trip from Adin) During the day, the weather forecast gradually improved, and the sky turned mostly clear after sunset. Because of a few high altitude clouds, the sky that night was not nearly as dark as it could have been. I got NELM 6.7 in Hercules.</p>
<p>Monday night was slightly better. Alvin and I both got NELM 6.9. This was still a bit disappointing. Under such dark skies, when the conditions are ideal, one can get NELM 7.5. Tuesday night was probably the best one. After a really hot day, I got NELM 7.0 in Hercules. The milky way looked absolutely gorgeous, all the way down to the southern horizon. The seeing was about average on all three nights, although it felt a little more solid on the last night.</p>
<p>I had put together a list of about 60 objects, most of which from the Herschel 400, containing mostly galaxies, nebulae and globular clusters. I did not want to observe too many open clusters from such a dark site, because those can be observed under less than ideal skies from the bay area. I ended up observing about 40 of those objects, leaving enough time for some free-style eye candy that I did not log. Some of the highlights include observing the central star in M57, as well as the nearby IC 1296 galaxy in Alvin Huey&#8217;s 22&#8243; scope. The crescent nebula was also putting on quite a show through my scope using an OIII filter. Finally, seeing both arches of the veil nebula in one field of view through David&#8217;s 80mm refractor was really amazing!</p>
<p>This was my first out of town multi-day star party, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Most of all, it was really great to finally meet a lot of TACos in person. The food cattered by our host, the owners of the Frosty Acres ranch, was absolutely delicious. The shower truck was awesome! A big thank you to the GSSP organizing committee for putting together the star party, and to David Cooper, who shared his canopy, and saved me from getting burnt by the Sun&#8230;</p>

Very bright, fairly large, very slightly elongated WNW-ESE. Gradually brighter to a relatively large, round and very bright core.</p>
<p><b>NGC 5195</b> GX CVn 13h30m25.2s +47°13&#8217;10&#8221; 10.5 mag 11:00p<br />
Bright stellar core surrounded by an assymetrical halo, fairly bright on the west side, very dim on the east side where this galaxy connects to M51. The nucleus is slightly off center to the south.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>On Tuesday morning, when I looked at the Clear Sky Clock, I noticed that the observing conditions were going to be ideal for that night: excellent transparency, good to excellent seeing, and no wind. Therefore, after much consideration, I decided to cancel my weekend trip to the D.A.R.C. observatory, and instead head to Lake San Antonio for a mid-week outing.</p>
<p>The drive to Lake San Antonio is rather long (2h20m) but fairly pleasant, especially the last 50 miles. The temperature was very comfortable (low 80s/high 70s), and the traffic was very light on Highway 101.</p>
<p>Once I arrived at the overflow campground, I was delighted to see that Jim Molinari had decided to join me. Jim brought his SpicaEyes 20&#8243; F/4 dobsonian telescope (http://www.equatorialplatforms.com/spicaeyes.html) I had heard of this brand before, but had never seen one myself. All I can say is that it looks like a solidly built (all powder-coated aluminum) fine piece of equipment, with lots of nice accessories (primary mirror thermometer, no clutches to engage/disengage the tracking system, etc.)</p>
<p>I proceeded to setup my equipment, only to realize a few minutes later that a large number of ants were passing through the area. I quickly moved my scope a little further in an ant-free area. Next time, I&#8217;ll have to think about bringing some insect killer to spray around my observing mat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Diehard Rogelio&#8221; showed up around 10pm to image a couple of southern targets located barely above the treeline, too low to capture from the bay area.</p>
<p>Early on, the seeing was a little soft, but the transparency was good. The light domes from King City and Paso Robles were barely visible, and the sky was truly dark. I had brought with me a chart of the big dipper labelled with star magnitudes. I was able to see, using averted vision, a star of 7th magnitude. Unfortunately, my chart was not showing stars fainter than 7th magnitude, so I cannot tell for sure what the naked eye limiting magnitude was, but the sky felt a little bit darker than at the D.A.R.C. observatory (not much darker though, maybe one or two tenth of a magnitude&#8230;) The seeing improved a bit as the night went on, and became quite good, although not excellent, after 1am. The temperature dropped surprisingly low, down to 38F at 3:30am. Good thing I had brought warm clothes!</p>
<p>I kept very busy all night, and managed to observe all the Herschel 400 targets I had on my list. Besides my &#8220;boring&#8221; prepared list, I got to see the Centaurus A galaxy (a.k.a. the &#8220;hamburger galaxy&#8221;) for the first time. Although very low above the horizon, the dark lane splitting this galaxy in half was pretty well defined, showing faint patches inside. This galaxy must be spectacular when seen from the southern hemisphere!</p>
<p>I feel like my star hopping abilities are getting better every time I go out. I really enjoy matching what I see in the finder scope with Uranometria, and finding the object I am looking for right in the middle of the field of view of my 16mm Nagler eyepiece. It&#8217;s like a &#8220;human goto&#8221;, only slightly slower (and quieter!)</p>
<p>Jim had brought his MallinCam color video camera, along with a small LCD screen. It was really astonishing to see a real time &#8220;video&#8221; (using short 7 second exposures) of NGC 3628 and M 51, and compare with views through the eyepiece.</p>
<p>I called it a night around 3:30am, slept for a few hours, and took off shortly after sunrise. I was home by 10am. Overall, I was very pleased with the sky at Lake San Antonio. However, I won&#8217;t be going there very often for one night only, mainly because of the long drive. Also, if you factor in the price of gaz and the campground fees, it amounts to almost $60. Finally, I was extremely tired all day on Wednesday, making for some interesting meetings at work&#8230; However, I can guarantee I will be going to CalStar this year!</p>
<p>Note regarding observation logging: I feel like my logging is improving in coverage and accuracy every time I go out. When I prepare an observation, I don&#8217;t like to look at photographs of the objects beforehand. I feel like it may affect what I document in my log, and not necessarily in a positive way. However, when I enter my log into SkyTools, I really enjoy matching what I saw with actual photographs. Most often, it matches pretty well. Sometimes, it matches beautifully as in the case of planetary nebula NGC 4361 (see log below), and some other times, it does not match at all, in which case I mark the object as &#8220;re-observe&#8221;. I also enjoy looking at the magnitude of the superimposed stars I was able to see. One of them for example (see NGC 4697 below) is of magnitude 15.3. A month ago, at D.A.R.C., under exceptional conditions, I was able to go as deep as magnitude 15.6! Not bad for a rookie using a 12&#8243; scope!</p>

This nebula seemed to be made of two &#8220;bars&#8221; centered on the central star. One is elongated 2&#215;1 E-W, and the other is elongated 3&#215;1 NE-SW. This impression was beautifully confirmed by looking at a DSS image.</p>

			<p>Although I knew there was a slight chance it might get a bit windy, I decided to observe at the D.A.R.C. observatory because I needed the darkness to observe delicate galaxies from the Herschel 400 list in LMi, Com and CVn. After a short and uneventful 1h40m drive from the south bay, I arrived at the D.A.R.C. observatory. The thermometer in my car was clocking 92F! The wind, coming from the north, was not terribly strong, so I proceeded to setup my equipment.</p>
<p>Early on, the seeing was pretty good, but the transparency was just about average as indicated by the light domes from Fresno, Hollister and Los Banos. The seeing remained good for the entire night, and the transparency got progressively better, yielding very decent images of deep sky objects. The wind almost completely disappeared and the temperature dropped from 92F to about 75F by 2am. It felt pretty good to observe in shorts and T-shirt. Only Rogelio was pesting against the warm and varying temperatures. It&#8217;s harder to cool a CCD when the air is warm, and the focus shifts as the temperature changes.</p>
<p>Since the night was short (about 4 hours of darkness), I kept pretty busy all night. I ended up logging 25 new objects from the H400 list, which makes it a good and productive night. Thanks again to Dr. Lee Hoglan for letting us observe on his property. Below is my log for the night. Cheers!</p>

			<p>Deep Sky visual observing requires very dark skies, far away from city lights. I live in San Jose, California, in the heart of Silicon Valley. One might think I need to drive long distances to find friendlier skies, but fortunately, the situation is not that bad. Here are some of my favorite observing sites around the south bay.</p>
<h3>Henry Coe State Park</h3>
<p>Description: State park near Morgan Hill<br />
Elevation: 2600 ft<br />
Latitude: N37 11.250<br />
Longitude: W121 33.016</p>
<p>This site is only a 45 minute drive away from my house, although the road is pretty narrow and sinuous for the last 10 miles. The light pollution is pretty bad, especially from the north east to the south east, so I only go to Henry Coe in summer to observe star clusters, and nebulae using a narrow band filter. If you get lucky, the fog sometimes rolls in and covers the cities to the north and the east. In those rare cases, it can get pretty dark up there.</p>
<h3>Dinosaur Point</h3>
<p>Description: Parking lot adjacent to the San Luis Reservoir.<br />
Elevation: 648 ft<br />
Latitude: N37 03.90<br />
Longitude: W121 10.217</p>
<p>This is my favorite observing site because it is fairly dark (SQM 21.4 on good nights) and is only an easy 50 minute drive away from my house. The only conspicuous light domes are to the east and the north west. This site is for winter observing only (including late fall and early spring) The winds are pretty strong during the rest of the year.</p>
<h3>D.A.R.C. Observatory</h3>
<p>Description: Private observatory located off of Little Panoche Road, near Mercey Hot Springs<br />
Elevation: 1400 ft<br />
Latitude: N36 42.4800<br />
Longitude: W120 51.08</p>
<p>This is one of my favorite observing sites. It is an easy 2 hour drive away from my house, and is a truly dark site (SQM 21.8 on good nights) I go there every opportunity I get!</p>
<h3>Lake San Antonio</h3>
<p>Description: A county park and reservoir, site of the annual <a href="http://www.observers.org/CalStar/">CalStar star party</a>.<br />
Elevation: 1000 ft<br />
Latitude: N35 49.22<br />
Longitude: W120 57.50</p>
<p>This site is the darkest of local sites, but it takes almost 3 hours to get there. Mostly for spring and fall galaxy observing. It gets beastly hot in summer, and pretty cold in winter. It is also occasionally susceptible to fog.</p>
<h3>GSSP</h3>
<p>Description: Private property on which the <a href="http://goldenstatestarparty.blogspot.com/">Golden State Star Party</a> is held.<br />
Elevation: 4400 ft<br />
Lat: N41 8.06221<br />
Lon: W120 580675</p>
<p>Located near the small town of Adin, in northern California. I&#8217;ve heard it was about as dark as it gets. Since I plan to go to GSSP this year, I will report back on the quality of this site later this summer.</p>

			<p>When I left San Jose, I knew there was a decent chance the wind could entirely ruin the evening. After a quick and uneventful drive, I arrived at the D.A.R.C. Observatory. The wind was indeed blowing very hard from the west. Around sunset, the wind started dying down and I decided to set up my equipment in the west dome, alongside Lee&#8217;s 16&#8243; Meade SCT, just in case the wind would decide to make a late come back.</p>
<p>Shortly after, we were treated with <a href="http://deepskycolors.com/pics/astro/2009/04/md_2009-04-25_Moon.jpg">a nice view of a day-old moon, followed by planet Mercury</a> and the Pleiades. What a nice way to start the evening! Later on, as the sky grew progessively darker, the zodiacal light was readily visible, although not as impressive as it was last weekend. The transparency was good, just not excellent&#8230;</p>
<p>The wind picked up again, and most of us found refuge inside the building for the next hour or so, watching a fantastic documentary retracing the history of George Ellery Hale: <a href="http://www.journeytopalomar.org/">Journey to Palomar</a> (PBS) I warmly recommend it, if you haven&#8217;t seen it yet.</p>
<p>Right after the movie was over, the wind died down again. It remained low for the rest of the night. Overall, the seeing was very soft all night, and the transparency was just average (although average transparency at D.A.R.C. means LMT of 6.5 upward!)</p>
<p>My observing list had a lot of small galaxies in Coma Berenices. At some point early on, I became frustrated because I had a terrible time matching what I was seeing in the finder scope and at the eyepiece with Uranometria, probably due to the lack of conspicuous field stars.</p>
<p>Around 1am, I started getting pretty cold. Around 2am, I decided to call it a night. I logged a disappointingly low number of new objects from the Herschel 400 list, but it was still a good night, and it always feels good to be out and surrounded by such great people! Below is my log for the night. Cheers!</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Peter Natscher reports:</p>
<blockquote><p>I did two NELM tests within transiting Leo at 11pm (between Alpha, Beta, Delta and Gamma Leo) and another one in Corona as it was transiting later on in better seeing.  They were 7.0 and 7.2 respectively.  OTOH,  my observations of Hickson groups and Abell planetaries at 250x with my 24 in. Starmaster appeared sub-par because of inferior sky transparency.  After midnight, the rising Milky Way didn&#8217;t have the expected brightness.  I believe the high winds from the Pacific lowered the transparency along with the seeing last night.  We got two decent hours of observing by 2 am but it was cold for this time of year.  I hope GSSP will be warmer.</p></blockquote>

			<p>I arrived at D.A.R.C. observatory around 7pm. Dr. Lee Hoglan and his father were already there, along with Albert Smith and his wife. Rogelio and his family joined us a bit later. It was a little windy around sunset, but the wind died down around 9pm. While waiting for the sky to get dark, I pointed my telescope toward Sirius, which was about 25 degrees above the horizon. Sirius&#8217; companion was seen pretty easily, which is always a sign of very good seeing. Saturn was absolutely breathtaking, showing a wealth of incredibly fine details. Later on, as the sky got darker, the zodiacal light became very obvious, reaching as high as 60 degrees above the western horizon, intersecting the milky way around Gemini.</p>
<p>Around 9pm, the sky turned dark like I&#8217;ve never seen it. Albert got an SQM reading of 21.84! It seemed a bit high to me, but Albert says he regularly gets readings of 21.1 at Fremont Peak, which is about correct. Under such dark skies, a lot of the galaxies I observed were starting to show intricate details.</p>
<p>Among the highlights of the night, I logged 27 new Herschel 400 objects. We also looked at a few bright deep sky objects: M101, M81/M82, M51, and later on, M83 all offered jaw dropping views.</p>
<p>Around 2am, Rogelio asked me what those &#8220;clouds&#8221; were toward the south east. The summer milky way was just &#8230; unrecognizable! All the faint extensions, all the dark nebulae that you don&#8217;t usually get to see at local sites around the bay area, started to appear. It truly looked like a photograph!</p>
<p>We finished off the night around 2:30am with a few more bright deep sky objects from the summer sky: M57, M27, M13, M17, M8, M20.</p>
<p>A big thank you to Dr. Lee Hoglan for the generous invitation! Last night was truly a night to remember.</p>
<p>P.S: still no sign of the elusive Gegenshein&#8230;</p>

			<p>I would like to thank Dr. Lee Hoglan, Dr. Bob Caton, and all those who have been involved with the D.A.R.C. Observatory, for their generous invitation. The site of the D.A.R.C. Observatory is a pleasant two hour drive away from San Jose, which makes it an extremely convenient location. It is truly dark, and offers great horizons, especially toward the south. By midnight, after the high clouds had dissipated, the sky turned &#8220;sugary&#8221;. The light domes from Fresno, Hollister and Los Banos were relatively inconspicuous. The seeing was decent, although a bit soft at times. Among the highlights of the night, I was able to log about 20 new H400 objects, saw Omega Centauri (NGC 5139) pretty easily in my 9&#215;63 binocular (I spotted it naked eye once I knew where to look) Peter Natscher also shared views through his 24&#8243; F/3.7 Starmaster telescope:</p>
<ul>
<li>M101, reminiscent of Rogelio&#8217;s recent photograph (see TAC archive)</li>
<li>NGC 4565, absolutely superb</li>
<li>A galaxy cluster in Leo (we counted about a dozen faint galaxies in one eyepiece)</li>
<li>A superb Arp galaxy (I can&#8217;t remember which one) with jaw-dropping intricate details</li>
<li>A globular cluster (M3 I believe) using a binoviewer</li>
</ul>
<p>Below are some photos of the event, followed by my log for that most excellent night. All objects were observed using my 12&#8243; F/5 Dobsonionan telescope. Cheers!</p>

<p><b>NGC 5457</b> (M101) GX UMa 14h03m35.0s +54°17&#8217;56 8.4 mag 11:40p<br />
Seen through Peter Natscher&#8217;s 24&#8243; F/3.7 Starmaster using a Televue Ethos 17mm eyepiece. The view was absolutely incredible! It was reminiscent of photographs I&#8217;ve seen of this galaxy. The spiral arms were superbly defined, and many bright knots (HII regions maybe?) were easily popping out here and there.</p>

			<p>When I arrived at Dinosaur Point around 6:45pm, the conditions looked bleak to say the least. The sky was almost entirely covered with high clouds, promising very poor transparency. After a quick setup, we were ready to look at the ISS. I caught a few glimpses of it through my 12&#8243; scope at 95x, and it was pretty big. However, without tracking, it&#8217;s sort of hard to see much detail. I should have brought my little Meade ETX 105 as it is able to track artificial satellites.</p>
<p>The sky remained pretty much unworkable until about 10:30pm, time around which it started clearing up nicely. Around 2am, I did a limiting magnitude test in Leo. I counted 20 stars in that triangle (that&#8217;s mag 6.3) However, as my eyes were sweeping that region of the sky, I was able to catch glimpses of many more fainter stars, but decided not to count them as I could not reliably keep track of where they were and how many I was seeing. Anyway, as you can see, the conditions were pretty good.</p>
<p>I spent most of the night in Leo, looked at some eye candy through Mark Johnston and Greg LaFlamme&#8217;s scopes, talked shop while waiting for the sky to clear up, and caught my first glimpse of M13 and M57 right before packing up. Overall, it was a good night, with 18 new H-400 objects logged. Cheers!</p>

Elongated N-S 2&#215;1 with a pretty faint non-stellar core surrounded by a very faint uniform halo. Located near the middle of the hypotenuse of a right angled triangle formed by 3 stars of similar magnitude.</p>
<p><b>NGC 3626</b> GX Leo 11h20m35.2s +18°18&#8217;11&#8221; 11.8 mag 11:00p<br />
Fairly bright almost stellar core surrounded by a much fainter halo elongated almost N-S 2&#215;1.</p>
<p><b>NGC 3607</b> GX Leo 11h17m25.9s +17°59&#8217;58&#8221; 10.9 mag 11:10p<br />
Fairly bright almost stellar core, surrounded by a roundish uniform halo. This galaxy forms an interesting group with slightly dimmer NGC 3608, located only 5&#8242; N, and much dimmer NGC 3605, located only 2&#8242; S-W. NGC 3599 is located about 15&#8242; W.</p>
<p><b>NGC 3608</b> GX Leo 11h17m30.4s +18°05&#8217;42&#8221; 11.6 mag 11:10p<br />

<p><b>NGC 3681</b> GX Leo 11h27m01.0s +16°48&#8217;33&#8221; 12.4 mag 11:25p<br />
Round, with a faint almost stellar core surrounded by a fairly uniform halo. This galaxy forms an interesting group with NGC 3684 and NGC 3681. These three galaxies are almost aligned on a N-E/S-W line, and are separated by about 8&#8242; from their nearest neighbor. Much fainter NGC 3691 is also visible, about 10&#8242; E of that line.</p>
<p><b>NGC 3684</b> GX Leo 11h27m42.3s +16°58&#8217;34&#8221; 12.3 mag 11:25p<br />
Round and fairly uniform, with no obvious core. The halo seems to become slightly brighter toward the center. This galaxy forms an interesting group with NGC 3686 and NGC 3681. These three galaxies are almost aligned on a N-E/S-W line, and are separated by about 8&#8242; from their nearest neighbor. Much fainter NGC 3691 is also visible, about 10&#8242; E of that line.</p>
<p><b>NGC 3686</b> GX Leo 11h28m15.1s +17°10&#8217;12&#8221; 12.0 mag 11:25p<br />
Elongated 2&#215;1 N-S. It looks fairly uniform, with no obvious core (a slightly brighter central condensation was suspected) A faint superimposed star is visible using averted vision, about 1.5&#8242; S of the center of the galaxy. This galaxy forms an interesting group with NGC 3684 and NGC 3681. These three galaxies are almost aligned on a N-E/S-W line, and are separated by about 8&#8242; from their nearest neighbor. Much fainter NGC 3691 is also visible, about 10&#8242; E of that line.</p>
<p><b>NGC 3242</b> PN Hya 10h25m14.7s -18°41&#8217;34&#8221; 8.6 mag 11:40p<br />
This nebula is also known as the &#8220;Ghost of Jupiter&#8221; nebula. At 95x, this planetary nebula appears very bright, round and very uniform. It shows an almost surreal fluorescent blue-green color. At 305x, the nebula loses its color, but starts revealing details, especially an elliptical ring, elongated 2&#215;1 N-S, nested inside the nebula. The central star was suspected during very brief moments. Its visibility seems extremely dependent on the seeing.</p>
<p><b>NGC 3655</b> GX Leo 11h23m25.9s +16°32&#8217;08&#8221; 12.3 mag 12:05a<br />
Elongated 2&#215;1 N-S with a non stellar core surrounded by a uniform halo. Located about 2&#8242; W-SW of a star of comparable magnitude.</p>
<p><b>NGC 3489</b> GX Leo 11h00m49.9s +13°50&#8217;55&#8221; 11.1 mag 12:20a<br />
Elongated 2&#215;1 E-W with an almost stellar core surrounded by a uniform halo.</p>
<p><b>NGC 3628</b> GX Leo 11h20m47.9s +13°32&#8217;14&#8221; 10.0 mag 12:25a<br />
This is an edge-on spiral. As such, it appears very elongated E-W. At 169x, the dust lane was detected, but not easily at all! The galaxy does not appear perfectly symmetrical like some other edge-on spirals do. It looks like its disc is warped a little. A faint superimposed star is visible near the eastern end, 1&#8242; south of the center line. This galaxy is a member of the splendid Leo triplet, which also contains the much brighter M65 and M66, located about 20&#8242; south. All three galaxies fit within a single field of view of the TeleVue Nagler 16mm (95x, 51.7&#8242;) and show distinct morphological differences.</p>
<p><b>NGC 3412</b> GX Leo 10h51m24.7s +13°21&#8217;37&#8221; 11.5 mag 01:00a<br />
Fairly bright, with an almost stellar core surrounded by a faint roundish uniform halo, very slightly elongated N-S.</p>
<p><b>NGC 3593</b> GX Leo 11h15m08.1s +12°45&#8217;52&#8221; 11.8 mag 01:05a<br />
In the field of view of the TeleVue Nagler 9mm (169x, 29.1&#8242;), this galaxy appears pretty faint with a non stellar core surrounded by a faint uniform halo elongated 3&#215;1 E-W.</p>
<p><b>NGC 3384</b> GX Leo 10h48m48.3s +12°34&#8217;37&#8221; 10.9 mag 01:15a<br />
Fairly bright with an almost stellar core surrounded by a uniform halo elongated 3&#215;1 NE-SW. This galaxy forms a beautiful tight triangle with brighter M105 and smaller and much fainter NGC 3389. The members of this group are separated by only 4&#8242; approximatively.</p>
<p><b>NGC 3810</b> GX Leo 11h41m29.5s +11°25&#8217;01&#8221; 11.3 mag 01:25a<br />
Pretty faint, with a low surface brightness. The halo looks pretty uniform, with only a slight brightness gradient toward the middle. The halo is slightly elongated 2&#215;1 NE-SW.</p>
<p><b>NGC 3640</b> GX Leo 11h21m37.4s +03°10&#8217;51&#8221; 11.3 mag 01:35a<br />
Fairly bright and large core, surrounded by a roundish halo.</p>
<p><b>NGC 3521</b> GX Leo 11h06m19.2s -00°05&#8217;17&#8221; 9.9 mag 01:45a<br />
Fairly bright and large, with a bright stellar core surrounded by a fairly uniform halo elongated 4&#215;1 N-S. The western portion looks slightly dimmer. I confirmed this later by looking at actual photographs. Dust clouds seem to be more prevalent on the western half of this spiral galaxy.</p>
<p><b>NGC 3912</b> GX Leo 11h50m35.5s +26°25&#8217;28&#8221; 13.2 mag 01:55a<br />
Using the TeleVue Nagler 16mm (95x, 51.7&#8242;), this galaxy is hard to find. A good finder scope is of great help! It appears tiny, faint, and elongated 2&#215;1 N-S.</p>
