		<description><![CDATA[I actually sold my Dewalt DW745 table saw and bought the Bosch 4100 instead. My primary reasons for selling the Dewalt DW745 is because it cannot handle full size (4x8) sheets, and you won&#039;t be able to use a dado blade with it. Otherwise, it will cut straight and true. Yes, the saw is very loud, louder than my Bosch table saw! However, the dust collection works better on the Dewalt than on the Bosch (I need to make some improvements to the Bosch saw to get the dust collection to work at its full potential) Hope this helps!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Happy Thanksgiving.

I am exploring the idea of purchasing the Dewalt DW745 table saw and I noticed that you are using it for woodworking projects.  The saw will be used for jewelry box projects, audio speaker cabinet construction, and small woodworking jigs made from 3/4&quot; MDF and crosscut 2 X 4&#039;s.  I have a 1/2&quot; router as well as a palm router.  I do not plan on ripping 4&#039; X 8&#039; sheet panels as I also have a circular saw.  I own an Incra Miter v27 and can replace it&#039;s stock miter gauge with it.I also own the TS-Aligner system and can tune up/dial in the saw if need be.  Assuming that the saw is properly tuned and the gear rod mod is done on the saw per Mr. Connor&#039;s user review on Amazon.com, do you believe that this saw would be appropriate for the woodworking  uses I have outlined above?  In simple terms, will the saw rip a straight and true cut?  Is the saw loud?  I ask these questions of you because most user reviews posted on the internet pertain to persons in the construction trades.  User opinions from woodworkers regarding the saw&#039;s appropriateness for woodworking is very rare or missing.  I hope to hear from you and your user opinions regarding this saw.  Oh, nice tenon jig.]]></description>
