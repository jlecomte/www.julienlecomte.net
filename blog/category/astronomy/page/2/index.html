			<p><b>General</b></p>
<p>Mark Wagner, Richard Navarrete, Steve Gottlieb, Peter Natscher, Rogelio Bernal Andreo and I met with our host, Kevin Ritschel, at his ranch in Willow Springs on Saturday, March 13, 2010.</p>
<p><b>Conditions</b></p>
<p>By sunset, the wind had subsided. The transparency was about average. Seeing was a bit soft early on, but it improved to just about average later in the evening.</p>
<p><b>Highlights</b></p>
<p>The zodiacal band was very obvious, pointing straight up, all the way to the Pleiades. The spiral arms around M 81 were obvious on both sides, although one side is much easier than the other. M61 was showing a lot of structure, reminiscent of photographs I&#8217;ve seen of that galaxy. Steve showed me a beautifully complex and surprisingly bright Sharpless object (Sh2-311? I&#8217;m not sure) in his 18&#8243; Starmaster telescope. We also looked at a couple of galaxies showing intricate detail in Peter Natscher&#8217;s 24&#8243; Starmaster telescope. Finally, Richard showed me an easy Hickson group (which one?) in his equatorially mounted Obsession 18&#8243; telescope. With my Meade Lightbridge 12&#8243;, I observed mostly Herschel 400 objects in Cam, Mon, Pup, Pyx and Vir. Among those objects, N2403/N2404 and the group composed of N4216, N4222 and N4206 were spectacular.</p>
<p><b>Star Hopping Technique</b></p>
<p>When printing an observing list, I always sort the objects by their Uranometria page and then by right ascension. I also sort the Uranometria pages from West to East and from South to North. Additionally, as a convenience, I always try to choose my targets in order to minimize the number of Uranometria pages I&#8217;ll have to refer to. When I want to point the first object on a given Uranometria page, I start by locating a naked eye star on that page as close as possible to that object. I then point my scope to that star using a red dot finder. Once I&#8217;ve confirmed the orientation of the field of view, I can hop from object to object using my trusty Stellarvue 9&#215;50 RACI finder scope in only a few seconds! Once the finder scope cross hair indicates the suspected location for an object, I look in the eyepiece, and the target is right in the middle of the field of view. Star hopping can be faster, more accurate, more fun, more rewarding and a lot more silent than a Goto! But it does require a bit of preparation&#8230;</p>
<p><b>The Big Freeze</b></p>
<p>My dew control equipment worked flawlessly, which allowed me to observe until about 12:30am (a respectable 5 hour session&#8230;). Around that time, the cold was becoming unbearable. No one specific part of my body was especially cold, but I realized that I was not able to focus anymore for long periods of time. I decided to take shelter in my car and slept for a couple of hours. Around 3am, I was woken up by Rogelio&#8217;s car headlights. I then realized that I was extremely uncomfortable because of the cold, and I&#8217;d better do something about it. So I packed the rest of my equipment and left around 3:30am, with the car heater set to its maximum setting. It took me a good hour to warm up. I made a quick pit-stop in Gilroy and picked up some breakfast at the drive-thru of a fast food restaurant. Needless to say that under such circumstances, it tasted mighty good!</p>
<p><b>Acknowledgments</b></p>
<p>Big thanks to our host Kevin Ritschel. I&#8217;m hoping to visit the Deep Sky Ranch again next month!</p>

			<p>Greg LaFlamme, George Feliz, Scott Baker, Rogelio Bernal Andreo, Al Howard and myself met up at Dinosaur Point last night. The transparency was just about average as predicted by the Clear Sky Clock. The seeing was quite soft early on, but it improved a bit to just about average as the night went on. The entire sky was clear and usable, except maybe for a few wispy clouds to the north. The wind was nonexistent. I did not think of getting a temperature reading during the night, but it was rather cold, causing me to bail out early. I eventually got about 5 hours of observing, and successfully tested new dew control equipment. Most of the objects I observed were bright targets from the Herschel 400 and Messier lists. One of the highlights of the night was seeing the spiral arms of M81 in Greg&#8217;s 22&#8243; scope, and later in my own 12&#8243; scope. We also counted a dozen members in the NGC 3158 group located in Leo Minor. When I left, Rogelio was doing &#8220;ass-trash photography&#8221; (those are his words&#8230;) while Al was acquiring data for his next APOD. All in all, a pretty good night! I&#8217;m now looking forward to this weekend, carrying the promise of even darker skies. Below is my log for the night. Cheers!</p>
<p>Location: Dinosaur Point [Elevation 648 ft]<br />
Telescope: Meade Lightbridge 12&#8243; F/5<br />
Eyepieces used:<br />
&#8211; Televue Panoptic 27mm (56x – 1.2° TFOV)<br />
&#8211; Televue Nagler 16mm type 5 (95x – 52&#8242; TFOV)<br />
&#8211; Televue Nagler 9mm type 6 (169x – 29&#8242; TFOV)<br />

(All times are PST)</p>
<p><b>NGC 2335</b> OC Mon 07h07m19.6s -10°02&#8217;50&#8221; 9.3 mag 07:20p<br />
Barely visible in 9&#215;50 finder scope using averted vision as a small and very pale smudge. This cluster is composed of about 25 moderately bright to moderately faint stars, plus a few fainter ones coming in and out of view, appearing within an area 10&#8242; in diameter. The brightest star (mag 9.5), located near the center of the cluster, appears slightly orange.</p>
<p><b>NGC 2343</b> OC Mon 07h08m36.5s -10°38&#8217;10&#8221; 7.5 mag 07:25p<br />
Already noticeable in 9&#215;50 finder scope. Contains about 20 moderately bright stars within 6&#8242;. There is a tight double (J2782A/B) in the center of the cluster. A pretty double, which brighter component, to the east, appears orange, grazes the eastern edge of the cluster.</p>
<p><b>NGC 2353</b> OC Mon 07h15m00.6s -10°17&#8217;15&#8221; 5.2 mag 07:35p<br />
Barely visible in 9&#215;50 finder scope. About 40 moderately bright to faint stars scattered within an area 12&#8217;x10&#8242; WNW-ESE. A very bright star (mag 6.0) is located at the SW boundary. Hipparcos data seems to show that the brighter stars in this cluster are superimposed field stars (the cluster supposedly being 3,600 ly away from us) which would explain the large brightness distribution.</p>
<p><b>M 47</b> OC Pup 07h37m04.8s -14°30&#8217;35&#8221; 4.3 mag 07:50p<br />
Easily seen in 9&#215;50 finder scope, along with nearby M46. Composed of about 80 bright to moderately faint stars scattered within 25&#8242;. Nice appparent double in the center, with components of similar brightness (mag 6.9 and 7.3). Small and faint cluster NGC 2425 spotted just 30&#8242; SE.</p>
<p><b>NGC 2423</b> OC Pup 07h37m35.9s -13°53&#8217;53&#8221; 7.0 mag 08:00p<br />
Located about 1° N of much brighter M47. Composed of about 50 stars of similar magnitude scattered within an area 12&#8242; in diameter. Nice apparent double star near the center.</p>
<p><b>NGC 2438</b> PN Pup 07h42m21.2s -14°45&#8217;34&#8221; 11.0 mag 08:05p<br />
This planetary nebula is embedded inside open cluster M46, providing a striking view at 95x. Fairly bright and round, about 1&#8242; in diameter. A moderately bright star is located just 15&#8243; SE. At 217x, two faint superimposed stars can be seen, the brighter one being located 5&#8243; NW of the center, while the dimmer one is about 5&#8243; W of the center. Using a UHC filter, the nebula shows up as a ring. The marginally darker inner region is about 30&#8243; in diameter. The eastern portion of the rim seems slightly brighter.</p>
<p><b>NGC 1444</b> OC Per 03h50m12.0s +52°41&#8217;36&#8221; 6.4 mag 08:30p<br />
A bright double star (Struve 446), which components are roughly E-W, separated by 15&#8243;, the brighter component being to the E (mag 6.7 and 6.8) is at the heart of this very poor cluster. A line of 4 evenly spaced moderately faint stars starts about 1&#8242; NW and ends 1.5&#8242; W of the double star aforementioned. 6 additional faint stars can be spotted within an area 5&#8242; in diameter. This object is marked as a double star in Uranometria 2nd edition (?)</p>
<p><b>NGC 2489</b> OC Pup 07h56m41.1s -30°05&#8217;42&#8221; 9.3 mag 08:40p<br />
This cluster is composed of about 3 dozen faint to moderately faint stars, fairly evenly scattered within an area 6&#8242; in diameter. The bright orange PX Pup is located just 25&#8242; S. Also, another cluster, named Haf 20, located about 30&#8242; S, was barely detected.</p>
<p><b>NGC 2567</b> OC Pup 08h18m58.5s -30°40&#8217;35&#8221; 8.4 mag 08:55p<br />
Detected in 9&#215;50 finder scope. This cluster is composed of about 3 dozen moderately faint stars scattered within an area 10&#8217;x5&#8242; WSW-ENE. 6 stars form a 5&#8242; long chain almost N-S located in the middle of the cluster.</p>
<p><b>NGC 2571</b> OC Pup 08h19m22.7s -29°47&#8217;11&#8221; 7.4 mag 09:00p<br />
About 20 moderately bright to moderately faint stars scattered within an area 6&#8217;x3&#8242; WSW-ENE, surrounded by a ring almost devoid of stars about 4&#8242; thick.</p>
<p><b>NGC 2627</b> OC Pyx 08h37m42.2s -29°59&#8217;42&#8221; 8.4 mag 09:05p<br />
About 2 dozen moderately faint stars over a milky background that seems to be composed of many faint stars, some of which coming in and out view as I looked around, within 6&#8242;. The southern edge of this cluster seems to be delimited by a region almost devoid of stars elongated E-W and 6&#8242; wide, with a few more stars just south of it.</p>
<p><b>NGC 3003</b> GX LMi 09h49m14.5s +33°22&#8217;20&#8221; 12.2 mag 10:00p<br />
Moderately faint, 4&#8217;x1&#8242; WSW-ENE, brighter core roughly 1.5&#8217;x45&#8243;.</p>

			<p>I decided to take advantage of a break in the weather and headed to Henry Coe state park. There, I found Jeff Weiss and Paul Duncan. Rogelio joined us a short while later, followed by Mark Johnston and his family. Even though it had rained the day before, the overflow parking lot was not as muddy as I had feared. The wind was a bit strong early on, but died down around 8pm. The temperature stabilized in the low 40s. Transparency and seeing were both slightly below average. At times, clouds covered almost the entire sky, only to retreat a few minutes later. My observing list was composed of bright targets, mostly from the Herschel 400 project, and mostly to the East or near the Zenith. I was able to observe until about 9:30pm. Around that time, dew really became a problem. Since I have absolutely no anti-dew equipment, it meant that it was time for me to pack and go home. However, before leaving, using Paul&#8217;s (dry) eyepieces, we were able to get half-decent views of Mars, and easily saw Syrtis Major, Utopia Planitia and the north polar cap. Overall, it was a fairly pleasant evening.</p>

<p><b>NGC 1027</b> OC Cas 02h43m29.3s +61°38&#8217;37&#8221; 7.4 mag 06:50pm<br />
About 40 fairly bright to moderately bright stars within an area 20&#8242; wide, centered on a bright (mag 7) yellowish (?) star.</p>
<p><b>NGC 650</b> (M76 &#8211; Little Dumbbell) PN Per 01h42m59.4s +51°37&#8217;54&#8221; 10.1 mag 07:00pm<br />
At low magnifications, this nebula appears bright, rectangular, 2&#8217;x1&#8242; elongated NE-SW. At higher magnifications, it appears to be composed of two oval lobes, each being slightly elongated NW-SE, and separated by a &#8220;bridge&#8221; of slightly lower surface brightness. The lobe to the SW is the brighter of the two, and a faint star appears at its southern edge. A UHC filter reveals faint extensions to the SE and the NW (the SE extension being easier to detect).</p>
<p><b>NGC 869</b> (h Persei) OC Per 02h19m44.5s +57°10&#8217;49&#8221; 4.3 mag 07:20pm<br />
Striking at low power, when nearby NGC 884 appears in the same field of view. Composed of 100+ bright stars scattered within a 8&#8242; wide area, with a few additional stars to the NW. Two very bright yellowish stars (mag 6.7 and 7.1) stand out near the center.</p>
<p><b>NGC 884</b> (Chi Persei) OC Per 02h23m02.8s +57°11&#8217;18&#8221; 4.4 mag 07:30pm<br />
Striking at low power, when nearby NGC 869 appears in the same field of view. Composed of 100+ bright stars scattered within an area 15&#8242; in diameter. A few orange stars can be spotted in and around the cluster, the most impressive of which is FZ Per (mag 8.0), located about 10&#8242; WNW of the cluster center region.</p>
<p><b>NGC 1501</b> PN Cam 04h07m54.7s +60°57&#8217;07&#8221; 12.0 mag 07:55pm<br />
Moderately bright and almost round, very slightly elongated E-W, about 1&#8242; in diameter. Very slightly darker in the center. The northern and southern portions of the rim appear very slightly brighter. Moderately faint (mag 14.4) central star easily visible when not using a narrowband filter. This nebula is also known as the (Blue) Oyster Nebula.</p>
<p><b>NGC 1502</b> OC Cam 04h08m47.0s +62°21&#8217;46&#8221; 4.1 mag 08:05pm<br />
Located at the southeast end of a popular asterism known as &#8220;Kemble&#8217;s Cascade&#8221;. About 40 moderately bright to very bright stars within an area roughly 7&#8242; in diameter, centered on a close pair of bright yellow stars (Struve 485)</p>
<p><b>NGC 1535</b> (Cleopatra&#8217;s Eye) PN Eri 04h14m45.8s -12°42&#8217;54&#8221; 9.4 mag 08:45pm<br />
Bright, round, about 15&#8243; in diameter, surrounded by a fainter round envelope about 25&#8243; in diameter. The central star was easily seen when not using a UHC filter. The region just around the central star looks slightly darker, although this may be a visual artifact (a DSS image shows that it is indeed real). The nebula shows a very light tinge of blue at low magnifications.</p>
<p><b>NGC 1664</b> OC Aur 04h51m52.0s +43°41&#8217;41&#8221; 7.2 mag 09:10pm<br />
About 30 moderately bright stars within an area 10&#8242; in diameter. One of the stars (HN Aur) appears prominently red on photographs, but I did not notice it. Since it is a variable star, its redness may vary over time. Some people find that this cluster appears to draw the shape of a kite, which is why it is often nicknamed the &#8220;Kite Cluster&#8221;. Others have seen the leaf of a clover (Walter Scott Houston). I personally see the shape of a heart. The string of stars to the SSE forms the string of a heart shaped helium balloon&#8230;</p>
<p><b>NGC 1857</b> OC Aur 05h20m50.6s +39°21&#8217;19&#8221; 8.4 mag 09:30pm<br />
About two dozen fairly faint to moderately bright stars scattered within an area 10&#8242; in diameter centered on a bright (mag 7.4) orange star.</p>
<p><b>NGC 1245</b> OC Per 03h15m26.0s +47°16&#8217;42&#8221; 7.7 mag 09:45pm<br />
Roughly 60 moderately faint stars spread fairly evenly over an 8&#8242; wide area, except for a couple of small regions nearly devoid of stars near the center of the cluster. Bright (mag 8.0) star about 5&#8242; SSE.</p>

			<p>After much consideration, I decided to head to the DARC observatory on Saturday night. It was a little bit of a gamble since the clear sky clock had forecast below average to average transparency, which usually means that wispy clouds would pass overhead, possibly ruining my chances of detecting the most subtle details on the faint targets I was planning to observe. But since it was the last opportunity to go out and observe during this new moon, I took the chance and hoped for the best.</p>
<p>I arrived after dark, around 6pm, and quickly setup my equipment next to Peter Nastcher and his 24&#8243; Starmaster telescope (always a prime spot) Shortly after, a &#8220;show and tell&#8221; presentation took place inside the observatory building. Dr. Bob Caton talked about some of the photographical work he&#8217;s done recently with his 4&#8243; wide field refractor and 20&#8243; Ritchey-Chretien telescope. Daniel Stefanescu talked about M1, and I briefly showed off <a href="../../../../index.html?p=386">a few photographs of the early construction of my new 16&#8243; F/4 telescope</a>.</p>
<p>Around 8:50pm, the sky got dark enough to start observing. As expected, thin clouds were passing overhead. Thankfully, they remained to the north, and never really interfered with my plans to observe Herschel II objects in Cetus. By 10pm, the sky was completely clear, and the transparency was actually very decent. The NELM was 6.6 in Aries. After midnight, the air became slightly drier and the transparency slightly better, bumping the NELM to 6.7. The wind was non-existant. The temperature was hovering between the mid and the low 30s. The humidity was high, but the optics remained mostly dew free for the entire night.</p>
<p>Among the highlights of the night, I saw the horse head nebula (Barnard 33) for the first time, using my 12&#8243; telescope and a UHC filter. I was actually surprised by how easy it was to detect. Using a Panoptic 27 without a filter, I was even able to see it along with Alnitak (Zeta Orionis) and the Flame Nebula (NGC 2024) in the same field of view. What an incredible sight! We also looked at the horse head nebula through Peter&#8217;s 24&#8243; scope, and the horse head shape was unmistakable.</p>
<p>The deep red/pink color in M42 was very obvious around the bright blue-green core region and in the two far flung extensions. The E and F stars in the trapezium were easily detected. Finally, Sirius&#8217; companion, affectionately called &#8220;the pup&#8221;, was seen by several observers.</p>
<p>I would like to thank Dr. Lee Hoglan and Dr. Bob Caton for their continued hospitality. It was a good night, and I&#8217;m already looking forward to the next opportunity to observe there. Below is my log for the night. Cheers!</p>

<p>I have always been a pragmatic person. While designing my telescope using computer assisted design software was a very rewarding experience, I have felt a much greater sense of accomplishment making it happen. This is why I am very proud to show off the mirror box of my future telescope. This is the result of 4 nights of work at <a href="http://www.sawdustshop.com/">the sawdust shop</a> in Sunnyvale. I am very happy with the way it turned out, and look forward to getting more work done in the next few weeks! <strong>Note:</strong> click on the thumbnails below to see the full size photographs.</p>

			<p>After a short (55 minutes) and pleasant drive, I arrived at Dinosaur Point early (around 4pm) because of the new access rules, and to have plenty of time to setup my equipment. Albert Highe, George Feliz and Peter Natscher arrived shortly after and setup right next to me. Dave Cooper, Jamie Dillon, Bob Jardine and Al Howard were a little further down the parking lot. What a great team of observers! (ok, Al doesn&#8217;t really count as an observer, but he&#8217;s cool nonetheless)</p>
<p>The wind was non-existant. The temperature dropped from the low 60s to the mid to low 40s, which is not a huge difference. This always helps with the seeing, especially in large newtonians. The transparency was about average until about 9pm, when it got slightly better. At 9:30pm, I did a NELM test in Triangulum and obtained 6.3, which is pretty good for the site.</p>
<p>Since I don&#8217;t have a whole lot of Herschel 400 targets left around this time of the year, I decided to observe mostly Herschel II objects, and finished the night with a couple of galaxy groups from Alvin Huey&#8217;s &#8220;Selected small galaxy groups&#8221; observing guide. Among the highlights of the night, we observed NGC 891 and M 33 through Peter&#8217;s 24&#8243; Starmaster telescope. The views were absolutely breathtaking! We also looked at the hydrogen filaments inside M 1, which we also detected through George&#8217;s 13&#8243; scope, and to a lesser extent in my own 12&#8243; scope.</p>
<p>Overall, I was very pleased with the evening, and it reminded me of why I like Dinosaur Point so much: short easy drive, fairly good skies, setup on a paved parking lot, in bed by 2am after 6+ hours of observing! Below is my log for the night. Cheers!</p>

<p>For the past few weeks, I&#8217;ve been designing my next telescope, an Albert Highe inspired 16&#8243; dobsonian. The decision to build my own telescope stemmed from the fact that I knew exactly what I wanted, and I could not get it from any of the well known US telescope manufacturers. In addition, I wanted to learn new skills, including computer assisted design and woodworking. The image to the left is the latest rendering of the optical tube assembly as I envisioned it (click for a higher resolution image). Below are my original specifications:</p>
<p><br style="clear:both;line-height:0;"/></p>
<ul>
<li>The mirror box and rocker box must fit together within 24&#8243; x 24&#8243; x 18&#8243;, so that it fits in my car.</li>
<li>The eyepiece height cannot exceed 64&#8243;, so that I don&#8217;t have to use a step stool or a ladder.</li>
<li>The weight of the heaviest component cannot exceed 40 lbs, so that I can easily lift it.</li>
<li>Overall cost must not exceed $5,000.</li>
</ul>
<p>I opted for a 16&#8243; F/4 mirror, which should fit my goals. In the next few months, I will be posting photographs as I build and assemble the various parts that make up the telescope. Stay tuned!</p>

			<p>I had originally planned to go to the DARC observatory on Saturday night. However, due to a dismal weather forecast, I was forced to rethink my plans. The forecast for Friday night was actually looking pretty good, and an opportunity came up to go to Willow Springs. I had never been up there before, so I jumped at the opportunity, packed my gear in a hurry, and headed down to Deep Sky Ranch.</p>
<p>While driving on Little Panoche Rd, something interesting caught my eye: a tarantula was slowly crossing the roadway. On the way back this morning, I pulled over to take this photograph:</p>
<p><img src="../../../../../blogfiles/20091017/tarentula.jpg" width="483" height="319"></p>
<p>Willow Springs is a great place for deep sky visual observing. The sky is fairly dark, and the only really noticeable light dome, emanating from Hollister, is not much of a problem. Here is a summary of last night&#8217;s weather conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>No wind.</li>
<li>Temperatures in the low 50s.</li>
<li>Average seeing.</li>
<li>Average transparency.</li>
<li>Very high humidity: my table top and paper charts were soaked, and my eyepieces were covered in dew.</li>
</ul>
<p>Were present Steve Gottlieb, Mark Wagner, Mark Johnston, Rogelio Bernal Andreo, Richard Navarette and of course our gracious host, Kevin Ritschel. Here is a photo of famous DobZilla, Kevin&#8217;s 30&#8243; dobsonian telescope:</p>

<p>Since I am almost done with the Herschel 400 list, I had decided to start a new project: observing the galaxy groups featured in one of <a href="http://www.faintfuzzies.com/ObservingGuidebooks.htm">Alvin Huey&#8217;s free downloadable observing guides</a>: Selected Small Galaxy Groups. These galaxy groups are fascinating because they are a real test of the observer&#8217;s visual acuity and equipment. Although the brightest members are usually immediately detected, these groups reward patient observers. The more time is spent at the eyepiece, the greater the number of galaxies that become visible! This way, I was able to detect a good number of members after spending about 30 minutes on a given group. I did not take detailed notes of my observations this time around, but I did write down the list of members I was positively able to detect. All observations were done using my Meade Lightbridge 12&#8243; F/5 dobsonian telescope, and using mostly my 9mm Televue Nagler type 6.</p>

			<p>Mark Johnston, Peter Krottje and I met at the overflow parking lot at Henry Coe state park last night. I brought my Meade Lightbridge 12&#8243; (after flocking the inside of the UTA with black velvet ordered from Edmund Optics), while Mark brought both his 18&#8243; Starmaster dobsonian as well as a newly acquired equatorially mounted 190mm Orion Mak-Newt. Peter was using his homemade 10&#8243; ultra light dobsonian.</p>
<p>The sky grew darker as the evening went on thanks to the fog dimming the lights emanating from San Jose, Morgan Hill and Gilroy. By 11pm, we were getting SQM readings of almost 21.2, which is pretty good for Henry Coe. The transparency however was clearly below average, and the low level haze was causing some obvious dimming up to 15 degrees of elevation, especially to the south and the west. The sky was however more than decent between the north east and the south east, which is where I spent most of the night, observing mostly open clusters in Andromeda, Lacerta and Cassiopeia.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a summary of the weather conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Average seeing.</li>
<li>Mild (but annoying) westerly wind.</li>
<li>Surprisingly cold (I had to really bundle up, and almost needed gloves by 11pm)</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some of the highlights of the evening:</p>
<ul>
<li>18 open clusters from the Herschel 400 list. Most of them were honestly not very interesting, except maybe the ET cluster, and a couple of clusters in Cassiopeia that happened to fit within the same FOV of my Pan 27, showing some differences in structure.</li>
<li>We observed the California nebula with my 50mm finder scope using a 16mm Nagler type 5 and a UHC filter. We got a much better view through Mark&#8217;s 190mm Orion Mak-Newt using a wide field eyepiece and an H-beta filter.</li>
<li>We saw the fourth flea around NGC 7331 through Mark&#8217;s 18&#8243; scope, and I later caught a glimpse of it in my 12&#8243; scope, although it was coming in and out of view (knowing where to look really helps!)</li>
<li>The GRS was transiting. A darker slightly elongated region was spotted right next to it. Probably some disturbance in the equatorial band.</li>
<li>There was a nice shadow transit by Io on Jupiter.</li>
</ul>
<p>It was my first night using the Orion self-centering adapter (instead of a standard 1 1/4&#8243; adapter with a tightening ring) and I have to say that I really liked it! I&#8217;m sure it will be very handy this winter when switching eyepieces while wearing gloves.</p>
<p>I took off around midnight, and was soundly asleep by 1am. Overall, it was a good night, and I&#8217;m glad I went out. I&#8217;m looking forward to observing under darker skies next weekend to start on the Herschel II list, since I&#8217;m running out of Herschel I objects. Below is my log for the night. Cheers!</p>

<p><b>NGC 7296</b> OC Lac 22h28m27.3s +52°22&#8217;19&#8221; 9.7 mag 08:00pm<br />
About 30 stars, a dozen of which are fairly bright, grouped within an area roughly 4&#8242; in diameter. Relatively inconspicuous, best seen at 217x.</p>
<p><b>NGC 7243</b> OC Lac 22h15m32.9s +49°57&#8217;09&#8221; 6.7 mag 08:05pm<br />
About 80 stars, 20 of which are pretty bright, within an area 25&#8242; x 15&#8242; elongated NE-SW. The center region, delimited to the west by a nice double star, is very sparsely populated.</p>
<p><b>NGC 7209</b> OC Lac 22h05m32.1s +46°32&#8217;11&#8221; 7.8 mag 08:10pm<br />
About 80 stars, 40 of which are uniformly pretty bright, within an area 20&#8242; x 15&#8242; elongated NNE-SSW. Moderately bright and slightly orange star near the center. Bright yellow star (HT Lac, mag 6.2) about 15&#8242; N.</p>
<p><b>NGC 7686</b> OC And 23h30m37.3s +49°11&#8217;31&#8221; 5.6 mag 08:15pm<br />
About 30 moderately faint to moderately bright stars grouped within an area 15&#8242; in diameter centered on a bright yellow-orange star (HD 221246, mag 6.2)</p>
<p><b>NGC 7789</b> OC Cas 23h57m56.4s +56°46&#8217;02&#8221; 7.5 mag 08:50pm<br />
Very rich and fairly compact. Very large number of moderately faint stars of comparable brightness scattered pretty uniformly within a roughly circular area 15&#8242; in diameter.</p>
<p><b>NGC 7790</b> OC Cas 23h58m56.7s +61°16&#8217;01&#8221; 7.2 mag 09:00pm<br />
About 20 moderately faint stars within an area roughly 5&#8242; x 3&#8242; elongated E-W. The proximity of numerous star clusters in the vicinity (esp. NGC 7788) makes this cluster interesting to track down.</p>
<p><b>NGC 129</b> OC Cas 00h30m36.0s +60°16&#8217;34&#8221; 9.8 mag 09:10pm<br />
Located 15&#8242; NNW of a bright star (HD 2626, mag 5.9) This cluster contains a good number of moderately bright to fairly bright stars. It is not very well delimited, especially to the north, making star counts unreliable. A few fairly bright stars form a ring elongated 3:2 NW-SE.</p>
<p><b>NGC 136</b> OC Cas 00h32m07.4s +61°34&#8217;04&#8221;  mag 09:20pm<br />
Maybe a dozen faint stars grouped within an area 1.5&#8242; in diameter. About 6&#8242; NE of a fairly bright yellowish star (SAO 11238, mag 8.4) This cluster is so inconspicuous that a good atlas is a must to confirm that you&#8217;re indeed looking at the right spot.</p>

About 30 bright stars within an area 12&#8242; x 8&#8242; elongated NE-SW. Requires some imagination to see the outline of a sailboat&#8230;</p>
<p><b>NGC 457</b> (ET Cluster) OC Cas 01h20m15.4s +58°20&#8217;27&#8221; 5.1 mag 09:40pm<br />
Two bright stars (mag 5 and 7, the one to the NE being the brighter), located at the western end of the cluster, about 3&#8242; apart, form the eyes of the ET cluster. A narrow group of stars, elongated NW-SE, form the body, and a few more bright stars form the arms.</p>
<p><b>NGC 559</b> OC Cas 01h30m14.5s +63°21&#8217;35&#8221; 7.4 mag 10:25pm<br />
About 30 fairly faint stars within an area roughly 5&#8242; in diameter. Best seen at 169x.</p>

<p><b>NGC 637</b> OC Cas 01h43m49.4s +64°05&#8217;29&#8221; 7.3 mag 10:35pm<br />
Small, compact group of about 20 stars, 5 of which are fairly bright, the others are fairly faint, within an area roughly 3&#8242; in diameter elongated NE-SW. Best seen at 217x.</p>
<p><b>NGC 654</b> OC Cas 01h44m44.2s +61°56&#8217;11&#8221; 8.2 mag 10:40pm<br />
About 40 moderately faint stars within 5&#8242;. Best seen at 169x. Located 3&#8242; NNW of a bright yellow-orange star (HD 10494, mag 7.3) Fits with NGC 663 in the same field of view of my Panoptic 27mm eyepiece, showing some nice difference in structure.</p>
<p><b>NGC 663</b> OC Cas 01h46m53.1s +61°17&#8217;10&#8221; 6.4 mag 10:40pm<br />
About 80 fairly bright stars within an area 15&#8242; x 10&#8242; elongated NW-SE. Fits with NGC 654 in the same field of view of my Panoptic 27mm eyepiece, showing some nice difference in structure.</p>
<p><b>NGC 659</b> OC Cas 01h45m07.6s +60°43&#8217;29&#8221; 7.2 mag 10:45pm<br />
About 15 moderately faint stars within an area 4&#8242; in diameter. Best seen at 169x. Located about 15&#8242; NE of a trio of bright stars.</p>
<p><b>NGC 752</b> OC And 01h58m18.5s +37°50&#8217;08&#8221; 6.6 mag 10:50pm<br />
Seen with the naked eye as a fuzzy spot between Tri and And. Best seen using the 50mm finder scope using a 16mm Nagler type 5 eyepiece. In my 12&#8243; scope, using a Panoptic 27mm eyepiece, more than 100 bright stars are visible. Two bright yellowish stars were seen near the south-western boundary (56 And and HD 11727, mag 5.7 and 5.9 respectively)</p>

			<p>I was only able to attend the first two nights of <a href="http://www.observers.org/CalStar/">CalStar</a>, an annual Star Party that takes place at Lake San Antonio in California. The first night (Thu, Sep 17), the transparency was mediocre (when I called it a night, around 2am, Jupiter was surrounded by a bright halo&#8230;). Therefore, I used that first night to focus on bright easy objects. The second night (Fri, Sep 18) was much better with an NELM of 6.7 in UMi. Seeing on both nights was about average. However, the high temperatures during the day caused my (thick) mirror to take many hours to cool down, even with the fan on (and I made the mistake of keeping the shroud on&#8230;)</p>
<p>Among the highlights, I was able to see Uranus (easy) and M 33 (hard) naked eye, as well as catch the two brightest satellites of Uranus with my scope. Dave Cooper and Peter Natscher also shared some superb views in their scopes (respectively an AP 6&#8243; apo refractor and a 24&#8243; F/3.7 Starmaster dobsonian telescope)</p>
<p>I thoroughly enjoyed the conversations I had during the day with fellow observers. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve come to love star parties. Even if the weather is not so great, it&#8217;s always a fantastic opportunity to learn new things.</p>
<p>Below is my log for both nights. Most objects are from the Herschel 400 list. From now on, I will start mixing in Herschel II and Herschel I objects in my observing routine, in addition to some objects from Alvin Huey&#8217;s awesome free guides: &#8220;Selected Small Galaxy Groups&#8221; and &#8220;Selected Galaxy Trios&#8221; (which I had printed and coil binded at Fedex Kinko&#8217;s) Cheers!</p>

<p><b>NGC 7142</b> OC Cep 21h45m25.3s +65°49&#8217;26&#8221; 10.0 mag 08:40pm<br />
Very inconspicuous group of about 40 moderately faint stars over a milky background. Slightly elongated WNW-ESE. A few brighter stars delimit this cluster on the north and east sides.</p>
<p><b>NGC 7331</b> GX Peg 22h37m33.1s +34°28&#8217;14&#8221; 10.2 mag 09:00pm<br />
Elongated 3&#215;1 NNW-SSE. Fairly bright core region surrounding a bright stellar nucleus visible at 217x and 305x during brief moments of better seeing. The halo is rather dim compared to the core. It extends about 6&#8242; along its major axis. The western half of the galaxy looks darker, due to the presence of a dark lane. Very faint superimposed star about 2&#8242; SSE of nucleus.  NGC 7335, NGC 7337 and NGC 7340 were easily detected. NGC 7336 was not detected. I did not search for nearby NGC 7325 and NGC 7326.</p>
<p><b>NGC 6210</b> (Turtle Nebula) PN Her 16h44m54.4s +23°47&#8217;05&#8221; 9.7 mag 09:25pm<br />
At 95x, this planetary nebula appears bright, almost stellar, and exhibits an obvious blue color. At 217x and 305x, the color is a bit washed out. At those magnifications, this planetary nebula appears round and very uniform, about 10 to 15&#8243; in diameter, and seems to be surrounded by a slightly larger and rather faint envelope (unless this is scattered light). I did not detect a central star.</p>
<p><b>NGC 6572</b> (Blue Racquetball) PN Oph 18h12m35.8s +06°51&#8217;28&#8221; 8.0 mag 09:40pm<br />
At 95x, this planetary nebula appears bright, stellar, and exhibits an obvious blue color. At 217x and 305x, the color is a bit washed out. At those magnifications, this planetary nebula appears very uniform, roughly 10&#8243; in diameter, and seems surrounded by a very faint envelope about 3 times the size of the nebula (unless this is scattered light). I did not detect a central star.  There is a faint group of a dozen stars 10&#8242; west.</p>
<p><b>NGC 7217</b> GX Peg 22h08m20.6s +31°24&#8217;39&#8221; 11.1 mag 10:35pm<br />
Bright, round non stellar core surrounded by a larger, relatively bright uniform halo. Faint superimposed star less than 1&#8242; NNE of the core.</p>
<p><b>NGC 7814</b> GX Peg 00h03m47.1s +16°12&#8217;11&#8221; 11.6 mag 10:50pm<br />
Moderately bright and large. Appears roundish at first, progressively brighter toward its center. At higher magnification and with careful examination, a faint halo extending NW-SE can be detected. The bisecting dust lane obvious on photographs was not seen.</p>
<p><b>NGC 7448</b> GX Peg 23h00m34.6s +16°02&#8217;10&#8221; 12.1 mag 11:00pm<br />
Pretty small, moderately bright, elongated 2&#215;1 NNW-SSE, faint nucleus seen intermittently at high magnification. Suspected the detached segment that makes this galaxy peculiar to be at the northern tip of the galaxy.</p>
<p><b>Mayall II</b> (M31-G1) GC And 00h33m20.0s +39°38&#8217;04&#8221; 13.7 mag 12:20am<br />
Appears faint and stellar, thus requiring a very detailed chart to find! Forms a very tight triangle with two field stars. In order to confirm the observation, I sketched a few field stars along with the position of the presumed globular. The result is very close to the sketch published by Sue French in the December 2005 issue of Sky &#038; Telescope&#8217;s Deep Sky Wonder column. I believe that excellent seeing and high magnification are essential to see the non-stellar nature of this target.</p>
<p><b>NGC 205</b> (M 110) GX And 00h40m56.5s +41°44&#8217;30&#8221; 8.9 mag 12:30am<br />
Fairly large and bright, elongated 2&#215;1 NW-SE, gradually brighter to a stellar nucleus.</p>
<p><b>NGC 891</b> GX And 02h23m12.6s +42°23&#8217;30&#8221; 10.9 mag 12:45am<br />
Moderately faint, elongated roughly 6&#215;1 NNE-SSW, about 12&#8242; along its major axis. The dust lane splitting this galaxy in half is clearly visible only through the central bulge. Several fairly bright stars are superimposed.  Peter Natscher&#8217;s 24&#8243; scope showed the bisecting dust lane much more clearly, along with some mottling.</p>
<p><b>NGC 7293</b> (Helix) PN Aqr 22h30m12.6s -20°47&#8217;05&#8221; 6.3 mag 12:55am<br />
Large, fairly dim, best seen using a UHC filter at low power. The ring structure, very slightly elongated NW-SE, can easily be seen. The NW and SE portions of the rim are clearly dimmer. A few superimposed stars, including what appears to be the central star, can be seen inside the ring over a faint background.</p>
<p><b>NGC 7662</b> (Blue Snowball) PN And 23h26m24.4s +42°35&#8217;30&#8221; 8.6 mag 01:30am<br />
At 95x, this planetary nebula appears bright, stellar, and looks slightly bluish. At 217x and 305x, the center region of the nebula appears darker, and an elliptical ring oriented roughly E-W can be detected. What I failed to see is the lumpy texture of the ring, beautifully documented in the October 2009 issue of Astronomy Now&#8217;s Drawn To The Universe column.</p>
<h3>Friday, September 18, 2009</h3>
<p><b>NGC 6822</b> (Barnard&#8217;s Galaxy) GX Sgr 19h45m32.4s -14°46&#8217;43&#8221; 9.4 mag 08:30pm<br />
Large (roughly 15&#8242; x 10&#8242;), elongated NNE-SSW, extremely pale, very easy to miss when sweeping the area, which is probably why this galaxy was missed by Herschel and was discovered so late (Barnard, 1881). There are a few superimposed stars throughout. A couple of small knots (probably HII regions) were seen using a UHC filter (although I did not note their position) This galaxy is part of the Local Group of galaxies.</p>
<p><b>NGC 7027</b> PN Cyg 21h07m25.2s +42°16&#8217;47&#8221; 9.6 mag 08:50pm<br />
Small, bright, exhibiting an obvious blue color, elongated 3:2 NW-SE, rectangular in shape, slightly wider on the NW side. A faint outer envelope, about twice the size of the nebula, was suspected (unless it could be scattered light)</p>
<p><b>NGC 6503</b> GX Dra 17h49m20.4s +70°08&#8217;46&#8221; 10.8 mag 09:15pm<br />
Fairly bright, moderately large, elongated 3&#215;1 WNW-ESE, fairly uniform with only a slight brightening of the core region. Detected a very weak nucleus or superimposed star.</p>
<p><b>NGC 7023</b> BN Cep 21h01m45.3s +68°12&#8217;26&#8221;  mag 09:40pm<br />
Fairly dim nebulosity, roughly 2&#8242; in diameter, around V380 Cep (mag 7.4). Dim patch around 2 to 3&#8242; south of V380 Cep (photographs confirm the presence of this extension). A UHC filter makes the nebula disappear, confirming its reflective nature.</p>
<p><b>NGC 7479</b> GX Peg 23h05m28.0s +12°22&#8217;45&#8221; 11.7 mag 10:20pm<br />
Moderately bright, fairly small, elongated 5:2 N-S, weak fairly large core. Moderately bright (mag 12.9) superimposed star at the northern end, slightly dimmer (mag 13.7) star about 1&#8242; SW of the center. Suspected some mottling in the core. This galaxy is actually a barred spiral. The arms should be visible under better conditions and with a slightly larger scope.</p>
<p><b>NGC 7078</b> (M 15) GC Peg 21h30m28.0s +12°12&#8217;47&#8221; 6.3 mag 10:25pm<br />
Fairly large, very bright, very intense core, resolved throughout. Located about 7&#8242; SW of a bright (mag 7.6) star.</p>
<p><b>NGC 7099</b> (M 30) GC Cap 21h40m57.3s -23°07&#8217;56&#8221; 6.9 mag 10:35pm<br />
Moderately large and bright, well defined core, well resolved throughout. The SE region looks darker. Quite a few brighter stars are visible in the halo.</p>
<p><b>NGC 404</b> (Mirach&#8217;s Ghost) GX And 01h10m01.9s +35°46&#8217;21&#8221; 11.2 mag 11:00pm<br />
Located about 7&#8242; NW of Mirach (Beta And), a mag 2.0 star exhibiting a beautiful golden color. Moderately bright and small, round, gradually brighter to a fairly bright stellar nucleus best seen at high magnification.</p>
<p><b>NGC 628</b> (M 74) GX Psc 01h37m15.2s +15°50&#8217;11&#8221; 9.7 mag 11:35pm<br />
Fairly bright and small core embedded inside a large round faint halo showing hints of mottling at higher magnification. Very faint superimposed star within 1&#8242; ESE of the center, slightly brighter one about 1.5&#8242; ENE. Spiral structure better seen in Peter Natscher&#8217;s 24&#8243; scope.</p>
<p><b>NGC 7606</b> GX Aqr 23h19m37.3s -08°25&#8217;42&#8221; 11.7 mag 12:10am<br />
Moderately large and bright, elongated 2&#215;1 NNW-SSE, fairly bright stellar core, uniform halo.</p>
<p><b>NGC 7727</b> GX Aqr 23h40m26.2s -12°14&#8217;02&#8221; 11.6 mag 12:20am<br />
Fairly small and bright, small round intense core, round uniform halo. NGC 7723 and NGC 7724 nearby.</p>
<p><b>NGC 7723</b> GX Aqr 23h39m29.4s -12°54&#8217;15&#8221; 11.9 mag 12:25am<br />
Fairly small, moderately faint, moderately bright stellar nucleus surrounded by a fairly uniform halo elongated 3:2 NE-SW. Located about 20&#8242; ENE of a bright yellow double star. NGC 7727 and NGC 7724 nearby.</p>
<p><b>NGC 253</b> (Sculptor Galaxy) GX Scl 00h48m04.1s -25°13&#8217;53&#8221; 7.9 mag 12:45am<br />
Very easily seen along globular cluster NGC 288 in 9&#215;50 finder scope. Very large and bright, elongated 6&#215;1 NE-SW. The core region is large, bright, and shows some obvious mottling (seen even better in Peter Natscher&#8217;s 24&#8243; scope). Numerous fairly bright field stars are superimposed.</p>
<p><b>NGC 247</b> GX Cet 00h47m39.8s -20°42&#8217;11&#8221; 9.7 mag 12:55am<br />
Pretty large, moderately faint, elongated 6&#215;1 N-S, very weak central condensation. Fairly bright (mag 9.5) star at the southern tip, moderately bright (mag 11.6) superimposed star about 7&#8242; S.</p>
<p><b>NGC 288</b> GC Scl 00h53m15.8s -26°31&#8217;34&#8221; 8.1 mag 01:00am<br />
Very easily seen along galaxy NGC 253 in 9&#215;50 finder scope. Fairly large and bright, fairly uniform, well resolved throughout.</p>
<p><b>NGC 613</b> GX Scl 01h34m47.8s -29°21&#8217;46&#8221; 10.7 mag 01:10am<br />
Moderately large and bright, elongated 3&#215;1 NW-SE, fairly bright small round core. Hints of two spiral arms, one starting at the NW end, bending towards the W, and a symmetrical arm starting at the SE end, bending towards the E.</p>
<p><b>NGC 7793</b> GX Scl 23h58m22.3s -32°32&#8217;00&#8221; 9.7 mag 01:15am<br />
Moderately large, fairly faint, elongated 4:3 E-W, faint almost stellar core.</p>
<p><b>NGC 524</b> GX Psc 01h25m20.5s +09°35&#8217;35&#8221; 11.4 mag 01:30am<br />
