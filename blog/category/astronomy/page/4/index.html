			<p>When I arrived at Dinosaur Point around 6:45pm, the conditions looked bleak to say the least. The sky was almost entirely covered with high clouds, promising very poor transparency. After a quick setup, we were ready to look at the ISS. I caught a few glimpses of it through my 12&#8243; scope at 95x, and it was pretty big. However, without tracking, it&#8217;s sort of hard to see much detail. I should have brought my little Meade ETX 105 as it is able to track artificial satellites.</p>
<p>The sky remained pretty much unworkable until about 10:30pm, time around which it started clearing up nicely. Around 2am, I did a limiting magnitude test in Leo. I counted 20 stars in that triangle (that&#8217;s mag 6.3) However, as my eyes were sweeping that region of the sky, I was able to catch glimpses of many more fainter stars, but decided not to count them as I could not reliably keep track of where they were and how many I was seeing. Anyway, as you can see, the conditions were pretty good.</p>
<p>I spent most of the night in Leo, looked at some eye candy through Mark Johnston and Greg LaFlamme&#8217;s scopes, talked shop while waiting for the sky to clear up, and caught my first glimpse of M13 and M57 right before packing up. Overall, it was a good night, with 18 new H-400 objects logged. Cheers!</p>

Elongated N-S 2&#215;1 with a pretty faint non-stellar core surrounded by a very faint uniform halo. Located near the middle of the hypotenuse of a right angled triangle formed by 3 stars of similar magnitude.</p>
<p><b>NGC 3626</b> GX Leo 11h20m35.2s +18°18&#8217;11&#8221; 11.8 mag 11:00p<br />
Fairly bright almost stellar core surrounded by a much fainter halo elongated almost N-S 2&#215;1.</p>
<p><b>NGC 3607</b> GX Leo 11h17m25.9s +17°59&#8217;58&#8221; 10.9 mag 11:10p<br />
Fairly bright almost stellar core, surrounded by a roundish uniform halo. This galaxy forms an interesting group with slightly dimmer NGC 3608, located only 5&#8242; N, and much dimmer NGC 3605, located only 2&#8242; S-W. NGC 3599 is located about 15&#8242; W.</p>
<p><b>NGC 3608</b> GX Leo 11h17m30.4s +18°05&#8217;42&#8221; 11.6 mag 11:10p<br />
Fairly bright stellar core, surrounded by a roundish uniform halo. This galaxy forms an interesting group with slightly brighter NGC 3607, located only 5&#8242; S, and much dimmer NGC 3605, located only 2&#8242; S-W of NGC 3607. NGC 3599 is located about 15&#8242; W.</p>
<p><b>NGC 3681</b> GX Leo 11h27m01.0s +16°48&#8217;33&#8221; 12.4 mag 11:25p<br />
Round, with a faint almost stellar core surrounded by a fairly uniform halo. This galaxy forms an interesting group with NGC 3684 and NGC 3681. These three galaxies are almost aligned on a N-E/S-W line, and are separated by about 8&#8242; from their nearest neighbor. Much fainter NGC 3691 is also visible, about 10&#8242; E of that line.</p>
<p><b>NGC 3684</b> GX Leo 11h27m42.3s +16°58&#8217;34&#8221; 12.3 mag 11:25p<br />
Round and fairly uniform, with no obvious core. The halo seems to become slightly brighter toward the center. This galaxy forms an interesting group with NGC 3686 and NGC 3681. These three galaxies are almost aligned on a N-E/S-W line, and are separated by about 8&#8242; from their nearest neighbor. Much fainter NGC 3691 is also visible, about 10&#8242; E of that line.</p>
<p><b>NGC 3686</b> GX Leo 11h28m15.1s +17°10&#8217;12&#8221; 12.0 mag 11:25p<br />
Elongated 2&#215;1 N-S. It looks fairly uniform, with no obvious core (a slightly brighter central condensation was suspected) A faint superimposed star is visible using averted vision, about 1.5&#8242; S of the center of the galaxy. This galaxy forms an interesting group with NGC 3684 and NGC 3681. These three galaxies are almost aligned on a N-E/S-W line, and are separated by about 8&#8242; from their nearest neighbor. Much fainter NGC 3691 is also visible, about 10&#8242; E of that line.</p>
<p><b>NGC 3242</b> PN Hya 10h25m14.7s -18°41&#8217;34&#8221; 8.6 mag 11:40p<br />
This nebula is also known as the &#8220;Ghost of Jupiter&#8221; nebula. At 95x, this planetary nebula appears very bright, round and very uniform. It shows an almost surreal fluorescent blue-green color. At 305x, the nebula loses its color, but starts revealing details, especially an elliptical ring, elongated 2&#215;1 N-S, nested inside the nebula. The central star was suspected during very brief moments. Its visibility seems extremely dependent on the seeing.</p>
<p><b>NGC 3655</b> GX Leo 11h23m25.9s +16°32&#8217;08&#8221; 12.3 mag 12:05a<br />
Elongated 2&#215;1 N-S with a non stellar core surrounded by a uniform halo. Located about 2&#8242; W-SW of a star of comparable magnitude.</p>
<p><b>NGC 3489</b> GX Leo 11h00m49.9s +13°50&#8217;55&#8221; 11.1 mag 12:20a<br />
Elongated 2&#215;1 E-W with an almost stellar core surrounded by a uniform halo.</p>
<p><b>NGC 3628</b> GX Leo 11h20m47.9s +13°32&#8217;14&#8221; 10.0 mag 12:25a<br />
This is an edge-on spiral. As such, it appears very elongated E-W. At 169x, the dust lane was detected, but not easily at all! The galaxy does not appear perfectly symmetrical like some other edge-on spirals do. It looks like its disc is warped a little. A faint superimposed star is visible near the eastern end, 1&#8242; south of the center line. This galaxy is a member of the splendid Leo triplet, which also contains the much brighter M65 and M66, located about 20&#8242; south. All three galaxies fit within a single field of view of the TeleVue Nagler 16mm (95x, 51.7&#8242;) and show distinct morphological differences.</p>
<p><b>NGC 3412</b> GX Leo 10h51m24.7s +13°21&#8217;37&#8221; 11.5 mag 01:00a<br />
Fairly bright, with an almost stellar core surrounded by a faint roundish uniform halo, very slightly elongated N-S.</p>
<p><b>NGC 3593</b> GX Leo 11h15m08.1s +12°45&#8217;52&#8221; 11.8 mag 01:05a<br />
In the field of view of the TeleVue Nagler 9mm (169x, 29.1&#8242;), this galaxy appears pretty faint with a non stellar core surrounded by a faint uniform halo elongated 3&#215;1 E-W.</p>
<p><b>NGC 3384</b> GX Leo 10h48m48.3s +12°34&#8217;37&#8221; 10.9 mag 01:15a<br />
Fairly bright with an almost stellar core surrounded by a uniform halo elongated 3&#215;1 NE-SW. This galaxy forms a beautiful tight triangle with brighter M105 and smaller and much fainter NGC 3389. The members of this group are separated by only 4&#8242; approximatively.</p>
<p><b>NGC 3810</b> GX Leo 11h41m29.5s +11°25&#8217;01&#8221; 11.3 mag 01:25a<br />
Pretty faint, with a low surface brightness. The halo looks pretty uniform, with only a slight brightness gradient toward the middle. The halo is slightly elongated 2&#215;1 NE-SW.</p>
<p><b>NGC 3640</b> GX Leo 11h21m37.4s +03°10&#8217;51&#8221; 11.3 mag 01:35a<br />
Fairly bright and large core, surrounded by a roundish halo.</p>
<p><b>NGC 3521</b> GX Leo 11h06m19.2s -00°05&#8217;17&#8221; 9.9 mag 01:45a<br />
Fairly bright and large, with a bright stellar core surrounded by a fairly uniform halo elongated 4&#215;1 N-S. The western portion looks slightly dimmer. I confirmed this later by looking at actual photographs. Dust clouds seem to be more prevalent on the western half of this spiral galaxy.</p>
<p><b>NGC 3912</b> GX Leo 11h50m35.5s +26°25&#8217;28&#8221; 13.2 mag 01:55a<br />
Using the TeleVue Nagler 16mm (95x, 51.7&#8242;), this galaxy is hard to find. A good finder scope is of great help! It appears tiny, faint, and elongated 2&#215;1 N-S.</p>

			<p>As I was driving up the winding road that leads to Henry Coe State Park, I saw a Mountain Lion. It was on the side of the road. It quickly turned around, looked at me for a brief moment, and then took off. This is a reminder that we are in Mountain Lion country, and that observing by yourself is not advisable.</p>
<p>I arrived at the overflow parking lot around 5pm. Rogelio Bernal Andreo joined me around 7pm, followed by Al Howard a bit later.</p>
<p>Overall, I was disappointed with the observing conditions. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll come back to Coe unless there&#8217;s fog. There is just too much light pollution. The milky way was barely visible. The western sky is a total waste, the south is bad, the northern and eastern portions of the sky are just ok. I am not sure the drive is worth it.</p>
<p>I packed up around 11:30pm. On my way down, I saw a wild hog &#8211; a big one! It didn&#8217;t seem bothered by the passing car and kept going up the hill.</p>

			<p>I arrived at Dinosaur Point around 4:15pm. I set up in the middle of the parking lot, which ended up being a fine location as I later found myself surrounded by Dave Cooper, Peter Natscher, Rob Enns and Rogelio Bernal Andreo. There was little wind, but there was a fairly thick haze visible that was made even more visible by the setting sun. I knew then that the weather conditions were not going to be ideal.</p>
<p>My goal for that evening was to 1) try out some new equipment (Starbound observing chair, Televue Panoptic 27mm, Televue Nagler 16mm, Orion RedBeam Self-Powered LED flashlight, ScopeStuff variable counterweight system, Catseye collimation tools, chemical foot warmers) and 2) start my Herschel 400 project.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with the equipment. I found the Catseye collimation tools (cheshire and auto-collimator) to be very nice once Peter Natscher explained to me how to use them. I also tried Rob Enns&#8217; laser collimator, which gave me different results. This is probably because my secondary is not perfectly aligned underneath the focuser. I will have to tune this alignment with a sight tube at home.</p>
<p>I found the Starbound observing chair to be a great value, very comfortable. The ScopeStuff variable counterweight system was a great help when pointing near the horizon (it renders the altitude brake useless) The Televue Panoptic 27mm worked great, but I was barely able to reach focus with it&#8230; The Televue Nagler 16mm was my favorite eyepiece, delivering great views. I also used an old Vixen LV9mm, which made me feel like I was staring through a peep hole&#8230; I&#8217;ll have to replace it with a Televue Nagler 9mm (the Ethos 8mm seems a bit too expensive) I found the Orion flashlight to be too bright (even on the &#8220;Low&#8221; setting) so I put some translucent tape in front of it. But then, I discovered that the battery life was not that great, and I had to manually crank it several times after approximately 3 hours of use. I&#8217;ll have to see if I can remove a couple of LEDs to lower the brightness and increase the battery life. Finally, the chemical foot warmers worked nicely, but provided heat for only about 3 hours, not the 6 hours advertised&#8230;</p>
<p>Early on, Venus, combined with the haze, was a major source of light pollution. Overall, I feel like I will have to re-observe a lot of objects (especially galaxies and nebulae) Star clusters are usually less affected by light pollution and poor transparency.</p>
<p>I used two atlases: The Pocket Sky Atlas and the Sky Atlas 2000.0. I feel like the difference between these two atlases is too small to justify using both of them. Moreover, I prefer the compact format of the Pocket Sky Atlas. Therefore, I&#8217;ll have to get the more detailed Uranometria vol. 1 &#038; 2 in addition to the Pocket Sky Atlas, and sell the Sky Atlas 2000.0.</p>
<p>I only have a red-dot finder, and I sometimes wished I had an optical finder too, especially when the object I was seeking was surrounded by several other conspicuous objects. A couple of times, I wasn&#8217;t quite sure which object I was looking at. I especially liked Albert Highe&#8217;s setup (his red dot finder is attached to a right angle optical finder scope &#8211; although I still wonder whether I should get a right angle or a straight view finder scope&#8230;)</p>
<p>Besides my prepared observing list, I observed Sirius&#8217; companion through Peter Natscher&#8217;s 24&#8243; scope. It was easy at 600x. I then tried with my 12&#8243; scope at 300x and I was able to see it too, though not as distinctly, and only during rare moments of steadier seeing. I also observed a couple of carbon stars including Hind&#8217;s crimson star, and before leaving, around 1am, looked at M51 through Rob Enns&#8217; 16&#8243; scope. Although still low on the horizon, the spiral structure was obvious (but the bridge between M51 and its companion galaxy was not detected) Finally, Dave Coopper&#8217;s AstroPhysics refractor gave superb views of Saturn.</p>
<p>Now for my observing list. As I am writing this, I noticed that I forgot to log a lot of important details (For example, instead of saying that a cluster is &#8220;large&#8221;, I should have tried to estimate its size in arc minutes. I also noticed that as the night went on, the logging got worse&#8230;) When I re-visit some of these objects, I&#8217;ll have to pay more attention to the quality of my logging. Overall, it was a decent night and I was quite happy with my newly acquired equipment. Cheers!</p>

<p>Here are a couple of photos of the Meade Lightbridge 12&#8243; telescope I received for my 30th birthday. Unfortunately, I haven&#8217;t been able to take it to a dark site yet because of the bad weather we&#8217;ve experienced in northern California in the past couple of weeks. But with a few additional accessories &#8212; a few Televue Nagler and Panoptic eyepieces, an observer&#8217;s chair and a couple of filters &#8212; this rig should be pretty sweet. Cheers!</p>

<p>GMT, the famous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwich_Mean_Time">Greenwich Mean Time</a>, is used everywhere. However, we should all consider not using it. Universal Time (UT) &#8212; or even better, Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) &#8212; should be used instead. Why? In a given location, the <em>real solar time</em> is the time indicated by the Sun on a sundial. It is defined as the angle, expressed in hours, minutes and seconds of time &#8212; 1 hour corresponding to 15&deg; &#8212; between the sun and the local meridian. According to the definition, it is then 0h when the sun crosses the local meridian, which is noon local time, and not 12h! The <em>mean solar time</em> is the <em>real solar time</em> corrected by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_of_time">equation of time</a>. The Greenwich Mean Time is the <em>mean solar time</em> at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Greenwich_Observatory">Royal Observatory in Greenwich, London</a>.</p>
<p>As you can see, GMT refers to an astronomical day starting at noon, and is thus not designed for civil timekeeping. Universal Time is the Greenwich Mean Time adjusted to have a civil day starting at midnight.</p>
<p>Universal Time (UT) is not a perfectly uniform timescale (the Earth&#8217;s rotation is not perfectly uniform) To compensate for this lack of accuracy, we now use Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), which is an atomic timescale (thus perfectly uniform) that approximates Universal Time (UT) by less than a second (remember hearing in the news that we need to add or remove a second to our clocks at the end of the year? Those are leap seconds to keep UTC in sync with the Earth&#8217;s rotation!)</p>
<p>Do yourself a favor and stop using GMT. Look smart and start using UTC instead. Cheers!</p>

<p>I just finished reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Modern-Moon-Personal-View/dp/0933346999/">The Modern Moon: A Personal View</a> by planetary geologist Charles A. Wood, and felt compelled to write a few lines about this genuinely brilliant book. I have been practicing amateur astronomy for the past 17 years, and have occasionally looked at the moon through various telescopes. But for some reason, our natural satellite has always failed to captivate my attention. I suppose you don&#8217;t take interest in what you fail to understand. Moreover, telescopic views of the moon are overwhelming with details, making it hard to decipher what you are looking at. Wood&#8217;s book brings order to chaos and does a great job at explaining the science behind some of the surface features of the moon. For this reason, I warmly recommend anybody even remotely interested in lunar geology to read this book. Observers will want to complement it with a good lunar atlas, such as Antonin Rukl&#8217;s Atlas of the Moon.</p>

<p>Every year, the Lick Observatory presents a summer concert series on Saturday nights to benefit the Lick Observatory Visitors Programs. Tickets are hard to come by, and the shows sell out soon after they go on sale. However, this year, I managed to purchase a couple of tickets, and last night, Brandi and I had the opportunity to spend the evening at the Lick Observatory.</p>
<p>The evening began pleasantly with an observation of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_prominence" target="_blank">solar prominences</a>, shortly followed by an hour long string quartet concert. We then got to observe <a href="http://www.seds.org/messier/m/m017.html" target="_blank">Messier 17</a>, an emission nebula located approximately 6,000 light years away from us, through <a href="http://www.ucolick.org/public/telescopes/36-inch.html" target="_blank">the Great 36&quot; Lick refractor</a> (the 2nd largest in the world!) After that, the renowned <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Marcy" target="_blank">Geoff Marcy</a> gave a lecture on &#8220;Searching for Earth-like Planets&#8221; [outside our solar system] Finally, we looked at a few deep sky objects, as well as Jupiter, through amateur telescopes stationed on the parking lot. Below are some photos of this wonderful event. Cheers!</p>

			<p>A few years ago, I was very active in the field of amateur astronomy. I used to take pictures of the planets and the moon using a MEADE ETX 105 telescope and a Philips TouCam Pro webcam. I have not been very involved with astronomy lately (I hope that will change in the next few years when I can finally move to a house with a backyard), but I thought I&#8217;d share a few of those pictures with my readers. The picture below features Mars (taken at three different times of the year &#8211; notice the ice cap progressively melting), Jupiter and Saturn. Also check out this <a href="../../../../../blogfiles/planets/jupiter-anim.gif" target="_blank">time-lapse movie of Jupiter</a> [200KB] showing the famous great red spot. Enjoy!</p>
