				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you know what 4/20 refers to, you know we must have had a good time! A few of us, including Mark Johnston, Rogelio Bernal Andreo, Jeff Weiss, Al Howard, Al Smith and I, met up at a private property located in the Little Panoche Valley, roughly 15 miles south of the San Luis reservoir. The temperatures remained in the 60s, which is good for observers, but not so much for imagers who have to worry about cooling their camera sensor&#8230; The seeing was good (4/5), not quite excellent though. The air was fairly dry. I estimate the NELM was around 6.7 (same as last week.) I re-observed a lot of Herschel 400 objects that I had marked as favorites, and observed a few Herschel II objects that were new to me. Among the highlights were observing Leo I for the first time, an incredible (and I do mean *incredible*) high power image of the Ghost of Jupiter (see description below), countless galaxies showing spiral structure, Mars and Saturn with nice crisp details. Below is my log for the night (mostly Herschel II objects.)</p>
<p>Log format: [designation(s)] [type] [constellation] [RA] [Dec]<br />
[magnitude] [date and local time (PDT)]</p>
<p>Location: D.A.R.C. Observatory [Elevation 1400ft]<br />
Telescope: 16&#8243; F/4 homemade dobsonian with Paracorr<br />
Eyepieces used:<br />
&#8211; Televue Panoptic 27mm (69x – 1° TFOV)<br />
&#8211; Televue Nagler 16mm type 5 (117x – 42&#8242; TFOV)<br />
&#8211; Televue Nagler 9mm type 6 (208x – 24&#8242; TFOV)<br />
&#8211; Televue Nagler 7mm type 6 (267x – 18&#8242; TFOV)<br />
&#8211; Televue Nagler 5mm type 6 (374x – 13&#8242; TFOV)<br />
(All times are PDT)</p>
<p><b>NGC 2784</b> GX Hya 09 12 53 -24 13 45 11.2 2012-04-20 09:10pm<br />
At first glance, all you see is a moderately bright core roughly 1&#8217;x45&#8243; E-W, gradually brighter towards the center. Upon closer examination, a very faint halo starts to appear around the core. I estimated it was 3&#8217;x1&#8242; E-W.</p>
<p><b>NGC 2986</b> GX Hya 09 44 51 -21 20 26 11.7 2012-04-20 09:15pm<br />
Round core, roughly 45&#8243; in diameter, moderately faint on the outside, moderately bright in the center, stellar nucleus. A very faint halo seems to extend as far as 1.2&#8242;. MCG-3-25-18 (mag 14.5) was easily spotted 2&#8242; WSW. A moderately faint (mag 16.3) star is 45&#8243; SW, another (mag 16.9) 50&#8243; NW and 2 stars (mag 15.7) 1&#8242; ESE.</p>
<p><b>NGC 3078</b> GX Hya 09 58 59 -26 59 27 12.1 2012-04-20 09:30pm<br />
40&#8243;x30&#8243; NNE-SSW, moderately faint in the center, faint in the outer region, smooth gradient. Moderately faint (mag 15.6) star 45&#8243; W.</p>
<p><b>NGC 3242</b> (Ghost of Jupiter) PN Hya 10 25 23 -18 42 36 8.6 2012-04-20 09:45pm<br />
The central star was spotted easily, along with a slight darkening around it, inside the &#8220;eye&#8221;. Also, the rim of the outer shell seemed very well defined. Finally, a very faint halo, visible using averted vision, was seen around the outer shell, especially immediately to the E. Beautiful sight!</p>
<p><b>MCG 2-26-27</b> (Leo I) GX Leo 10 09 09 +12 14 35 11.2 2012-04-20 09:50pm<br />
Seen with difficulty and confirmed by Mark Johnston as a very pale glow, maybe 3&#8217;x1&#8242; E-W. Better keep Regulus out of the FOV!</p>
<p><b>NGC 4880</b> GX Vir 13 00 49 +12 24 52 13.1 2012-04-21 12:10am<br />
Faint, relatively uniform glow 1&#8217;x45&#8243; NNW-SSE.</p>

Located just 2&#8242; NW of M60. Round, diffuse, about 1.2&#8242; in diameter, fairly uniform, moderately faint, slightly and gradually brighter towards the center.</p>
<p><b>NGC 4639</b> GX Vir 12 43 31 +13 11 11 12.2 2012-04-21 12:25am<br />
Moderately faint halo, 1.2&#8217;x50&#8243; N-S. Moderately bright, small, almost stellar core. Moderately bright (mag 15.2) star 45&#8243; SE.</p>
<p><b>NGC 4608</b> GX Vir 12 41 52 +10 05 07 12.1 2012-04-21 12:30am<br />
1&#8217;x40&#8243; faint &#8220;halo&#8221; (this is actually the bar of this barred spiral galaxy&#8230;) elongated NE-SW. Round, 20&#8243; in diameter, moderately bright core. Located right near Rho Vir (mag 4.9!)</p>
<p><b>NGC 4612</b> GX Vir 12 42 12 +07 14 40 12.1 2012-04-21 12:35am<br />
Moderately faint to moderately bright in its center, round, 45&#8243; in diameter. Uninteresting, except for the fact that it is located at the SE end of a chain of 6 fairly bright stars spanning 9&#8242;.</p>

Round, about 2&#8242; in diameter, very faint and uniform. Small, round, only slightly brighter core. Located 2&#8242; SSW of a bright (mag 8.9) star (SAO 100177). Moderately faint (mag 15.1) superimposed star at the western end.</p>
<p><b>NGC 5020</b> GX Vir 13 13 18 +12 31 54 13.0 2012-04-21 12:55am<br />
Moderately bright round core 15&#8243; in diameter surrounded by a halo 1.5&#8217;x1.2&#8242; elongated N-S showing signs of spiral arms. In particular, the northern tip of the halo bends to the W while the southern tip bends to the E. A moderately faint (mag 14.0) star can be seen 2&#8242; NW.</p>
<p><b>NGC 5129</b> GX Vir 13 24 48 +13 54 35 13.0 2012-04-21 01:00am<br />
Located right next to 2 bright field stars (mag 9.7 and 10.3). Roundish, about 30&#8243; in diameter, slightly elongated N-S, moderately faint and uniform.</p>
<p><b>NGC 5806</b> GX Vir 15 00 40 +01 50 25 12.4 2012-04-21 01:20am<br />
Fairly faint halo 1.5&#8217;x1&#8242; NNW-SSE. Moderately bright, small (10&#8243; in diameter?) core.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last night, Richard Navarette, Mark Johnston, Jeff Weiss, Al Howard, Rogelio Bernal Andreo and I met at the DARC observatory, a private property located in the Diablo Range, roughly 15 miles south of the San Luis reservoir. As I was driving down I-5 on my way there, the sky was completely overcast! However, it cleared up nicely by the end of astronomical twilight (9:09pm) and the sky remained clear all night. There was quite a bit of humidity in the air, and the work tables/paper charts got a bit wet. However, nobody had any issues with dew as far as I know. The temperatures dipped as low as 38F. The wind was pretty much non existent. Although I did not do any formal measurements, I estimate by experience that the NELM was around 6.7. There must have been some fog in the central valley because the light dome from Fresno was almost invisible, and this must have helped a bit with the darkness. The seeing was just about average. Among the highlights, M101 was showing a lot of structure, which is usually a sign of good conditions. NGC 2903 and NGC 4725 (which Al was imaging) also were showing a lot of structure. We observed comet Garradd, which is still going strong. Finally, Mars looked pretty good with numerous surface features easily visible whenever the seeing settled. Besides the obligatory eye candy, I mostly observed galaxies from the Herschel II list with my 16&#8243; F/4 homemade dobsonian telescope. Below is my log for the night. Cheers!</p>

<p><b>NGC 3652</b> GX UMa 11 23 21 +37 41 45 12.2 2012-04-14 09:00pm<br />
Fairly uniform faint core measuring 1&#8217;x45&#8243; elongated NNW-SSE surrounded by a very faint halo that was suspected to stretch as much as 2.5&#8217;x1&#8242;. Upon close examination, the halo seemed &#8220;assymetrical&#8221; in brightness, which may be caused by two far flung spiral arms. While observing, I sketched what I think I saw and later verified that the spiral arms matched exactly my sketch.</p>
<p><b>NGC 4062</b> GX UMa 12 04 43 +31 49 29 11.9 2012-04-14 09:15pm<br />
Fairly uniform faint halo 3.5&#8217;x1&#8242; E-W. Slightly brighter core 1&#8217;x30&#8243;. Moderately faint (mag 17.1) superimposed star roughly 1.2&#8242; W of the core. Very faint (mag 17.7) superimposed star just east of the eastern tip of the halo.</p>

Fairly bright halo 10&#8217;x1&#8242; NE-SW, slightly and gradually brighter towards the center. A tight pair of mag 15.3 stars are located just outside the halo 2&#8217;NNE of the core. A fairly bright (mag 13) star is located just north of the NE tip. Best seen at low magnification (Nagler 16mm)</p>
<p><b>NGC 4369</b> GX CVn 12 25 14 +39 18 47 12.4 2012-04-14 09:40pm<br />
Very bright round core roughly 15&#8243; in diameter. Moderately bright round halo measuring 45&#8243;, surrounded by a very faint and thus ill-defined halo which seems to extend as much as 1.5&#8242;.</p>
<p><b>NGC 4395</b> GX CVn 12 26 27 +33 28 36 10.8 2012-04-14 09:45pm<br />
At low magnification (Nagler 16mm), this galaxy appears as a very pale oval measuring 6&#8217;x4&#8242; elongated in the NW-SE direction. It is very uniform, but close examination shows some subtle mottling. At higher magnification (Nagler 9mm), I can spot 2 knots near the center on a NW-SE line. The halo also shows a hint of spiral structure with the NW tip bending towards towards the N and the SE tip bending towards the S.</p>
<p><b>NGC 3642</b> GX UMa 11 23 02 +59 00 24 11.7 2012-04-14 10:00pm<br />
Fairly bright round core roughly 20&#8243; in diameter surrounded by a faint halo which seems to be round and extend as much as 1&#8242;. At high magnification (Nagler 5mm), the halo gives an impression of mottling. A faint superimposed star (mag 15.0) shows up 15&#8243; W of the core.</p>
<p><b>NGC 3669</b> GX UMa 11 26 10 +57 39 15 12.6 2012-04-14 10:15pm<br />
Moderately faint and uniform halo 2&#8217;x30&#8243; NNW-SSE. No sign of central condensation&#8230;</p>
<p><b>NGC 3683</b> GX UMa 11 28 15 +56 48 34 12.9 2012-04-14 10:30pm<br />
Moderately faint, fairly uniform, 1.5&#8217;x20&#8243; NW-SE, slightly brighter in the center, hints of a stellar nucleus.</p>

Moderately faint, 3&#8217;x1&#8242; NS, very uniform, barely brighter in the center region. Fairly bright (mag 10.6) field star 4&#8242; NNW.</p>
<p><b>NGC 4271</b> GX UMa 12 20 11 +56 40 03 13.6 2012-04-14 11:00pm<br />
Fairly bright, tiny (but non stellar) core surrounded by a fairly faint halo roughly 30&#8243; in diameter. Moderately faint (mag 15.5) star 30&#8243; NNE. Moderately faint (mag 15.5) star 1&#8242; W.</p>
<p><b>NGC 4290</b> GX UMa 12 21 25 +58 01 24 12.7 2012-04-14 11:10pm<br />
Faint smudge roughly 1&#8242; in diameter, slightly elongated E-W, fairly uniform. Interesting FOV in Nagler 7mm with 2 field stars forming an equilateral triangle and NGC 4284 just 5&#8242; east.</p>
<p><b>NGC 5204</b> GX UMa 13 30 06 +58 21 18 11.7 2012-04-14 11:30pm<br />
Moderately faint and uniform halo measuring 1.5&#8217;x1&#8242; NNW-SSE. Note: this is actually the core that we saw. The halo extends further out&#8230;</p>
<p><b>NGC 5308</b> GX UMa 13 47 27 +60 54 36 12.2 2012-04-14 11:45pm<br />
Nice edge on showing its bulb. 2&#8217;x20&#8243; NE-SW. Bright round core roughly 20&#8243; in diameter. Moderately bright halo, slightly brighter in the SW half.</p>

Faint halo 1.5&#8217;x30&#8243; NNE-SSW. Tiny non stellar moderately bright core. Moderately faint (mag 14.8) superimposed star at the SSW tip.</p>
<p><b>NGC 5485</b> GX UMa 14 07 39 +54 56 28 12.4 2012-04-15 12:15am<br />
Roundish, slightly elongated NW-SE, moderately bright, fairly uniform, roughly 1&#8242; in diameter. A faint (mag 16.4) is 1.2&#8242; NNE. A brighter (mag 13.9) star is 2&#8242; ESE. Forms a nice trio with NGC 5484 and NGC 5486, both much dimmer.</p>
<p><b>NGC 5585</b> GX UMa 14 20 13 +56 40 13 11.4 2012-04-15 12:30am<br />
Moderately faint round core, rouhgly 1.5&#8242; in diameter, gradually fading to an ill defined halo maybe 3&#8242; in diameter showing hints of mottling&#8230; A moderately faint (mag 15.8) star is 2&#8242; E. Another one (mag 14.8) is 2&#8242; S.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Were present: George Feliz, Rogelio Bernal Andreo, Paul Duncan, Peter Natscher, Jim Molinari, Jeff Weiss and myself. The conditions were extremely pleasant: warm (temps in the 50s), dry, no wind. The transparency was good (NELM 6.2 in UMi) and the seeing was good to excellent (4/5). We followed a GRS transit on Jupiter, which was showing a lot of details. The Gegenshein was seen fairly easily by several people after I pointed it out, just south of the body of Aries. I saw quite a few shooting stars throughout the evening, some of them were slow movers and pretty bright. I used my laptop and SkyTools 3 on the field for the first time fairly successfully, but noticed a few kinks I am going to have to work out. Below is my log for the night.</p>
<p>Log format: [designation(s)] [type] [constellation] [RA] [Dec]<br />
[magnitude] [date and local time (PDT)]</p>
<p>Location: Dinosaur Point [Elevation 648 ft]<br />
Telescope: Meade Lightbridge 12&#8243; F/5<br />
Eyepieces used:<br />
&#8211; Televue Panoptic 27mm (56x – 1.2° TFOV)<br />
&#8211; Televue Nagler 16mm type 5 (95x – 52&#8242; TFOV)<br />
&#8211; Televue Nagler 9mm type 6 (169x – 29&#8242; TFOV)<br />

&#8211; Televue Nagler 5mm type 6 (305x – 16&#8242; TFOV)<br />
(All times are PDT)</p>
<p><b>NGC 7419</b> OC Cep 22 54 48 +60 52 46 13.0 2010-11-02 07:50pm<br />
Appears as a barely resolved smudge at low power (95x). At 305x, a dozen faint stars over a hazy background that seems to be composed of many more very faint stars can be spotted within 3&#8242;. A moderately bright (mag. 10.5) star lays just outside, 2&#8242; NW. A fairly bright (mag. 8.6) star is 5&#8242; NW.</p>
<p><b>NGC 7762</b> OC Cep 23 50 36 +68 06 17   2010-11-02 08:05pm<br />
About 20&#8217;x10&#8242; NW-SE. Composed of roughly 30 fairly faint stars over a hazy background, with many more faint stars popping in and out of view. A very bright (mag. 5.0) star is located just 20&#8242; SW.</p>
<p><b>NGC 6997</b> OC Cyg 20 56 53 +44 41 53   2010-11-02 08:20pm<br />
Roughly 30 moderately bright stars scattered within an area 8&#8242; in diameter. Looks best at low power (Pan 27 &#8211; 1.2 degree TFOV) where the cluster appears located inside a triangle of very bright stars, surrounded by large dark areas devoid of stars contrasting with ambient nebulosity from the North America nebula (NGC 7000).</p>
<p><b>NGC 55</b> GX Scl 00 15 43 -39 09 33 8.5 2010-11-02 09:30pm<br />
Observed just above the hills surrounding the Dinosaur Point parking lot, this galaxy suffers greatly from atmospheric extinction at our latitudes. About 20&#8217;x5&#8242; WNW-ESE. The bright core measures 8&#8217;x5&#8242; and is offset towards the W. The eastern half of the halo is much dimmer. Some mottling seen pretty easily, especially inside and around the core.</p>
<p><b>NGC 147</b> GX Cas 00 33 50 +48 34 25 10.6 2010-11-02 10:10pm<br />
Diffuse moderately faint round glow, slightly brighter toward the center, about 4&#8242; in diameter, very slightly elongated E-W (strange! the real PA is NNW-SSE!) This dwarf spheroidal galaxy is a member of the Local Group and a satellite of the Andromeda galaxy.</p>
<p><b>NGC 410</b> GX Psc 01 11 37 +33 12 48 12.5 2010-11-02 10:35pm<br />
Round diffuse faint halo, about 50&#8243; in diameter, with a moderately bright almost stellar core. In the center of a triangle formed by 3 galaxies belonging to the same group/cluster, all seen at 217x.</p>
<p><b>NGC 499</b> GX Psc 01 23 50 +33 31 15 13.3 2010-11-02 10:55pm<br />
Very faint halo 40&#8243;x30&#8243; E-W, small (~ 10&#8243;) moderately faint round core. Located in an area very rich in galaxies.</p>
<p><b>NGC 513</b> GX And 01 25 06 +33 51 36 13.2 2010-11-02 11:05pm<br />
Moderately faint diffuse glow, about 30&#8243;x20&#8243; E-W, slightly and gradually brighter toward the center.</p>
<p><b>NGC 821</b> GX Ari 02 08 58 +11 03 04 11.7 2010-11-02 11:50pm<br />
Diffuse round glow (size not noted?), moderately faint, slightly and gradually brighter toward the center, moderately bright stellar nucleus. A fairly bright (mag. 9.2) is 1&#8242; NNW. A moderately bright (mag. 12.9) star is 2&#8242; S.</p>
<p><b>NGC 1012</b> GX Ari 02 39 56 +30 12 04 13.1 2010-11-02 12:00am<br />
Faint halo 1.5&#8217;x30&#8243; NNE-SSW. Moderately faint core 30&#8243;x10&#8243;. A superimposed star is located 15&#8243; SE of the core.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Attendance at this year&#8217;s CalStar was surprisingly low compared to last year. I setup in the &#8220;dark enforced area&#8221;, right next to Mark Johnston whom I must thank for helping me get out of a bad battery situation&#8230;</p>
<p>The skies were roughly similar on Friday and Saturday night. I estimated the NELM was around 6.5 while seeing was average to slightly better than average after midnight. Friday night was very dewy, and Saturday night was a little breezy at times. Temps were in the mid 80s during the day and dropped to the low 40s by the time I went to bed (~2am)</p>
<p>Comet Hartley 2 was a real treat on Friday night through Mark Johnston&#8217;s William Optics 110mm triplet refractor. Outfitted with a Televue Nagler 26mm eyepiece, the comet was visible along with the double cluster in the same field of view! On Saturday night, Hartley 2 had moved and was located right near a rather bright (~ mag 6) orange star. Jupiter also put on a good show, with an Io shadow transit on Friday and a GRS transit on Saturday.</p>
<p>My observing list consisted of a mixed bag of rather difficult objects for a 12&#8243; scope: a few Palomar globular clusters, a tiny proto-planetary nebula, a few local group members, and some Herschel II objects. I also spent some time observing several galaxy groups, using Alvin&#8217;s guide &#8220;Selected small galaxy groups&#8221;.</p>
<p>Log format: [designation(s)] [type] [constellation] [RA] [Dec] [magnitude] [date and local time (PDT)]</p>
<p>Location: Lake San Antonio [Elevation 1082 ft]<br />
Telescope: Meade Lightbridge 12&#8243; F/5<br />
Eyepieces used:<br />
&#8211; Televue Panoptic 27mm (56x – 1.2° TFOV)<br />
&#8211; Televue Nagler 16mm type 5 (95x – 52&#8242; TFOV)<br />
&#8211; Televue Nagler 9mm type 6 (169x – 29&#8242; TFOV)<br />
&#8211; Televue Nagler 7mm type 6 (217x – 22&#8242; TFOV)<br />
&#8211; Televue Nagler 5mm type 6 (305x – 16&#8242; TFOV)<br />
(All times are PDT)</p>
<h3>Galaxy groups observed on Saturday night</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>NGC 6211 group:</b> saw all 4 members, forming a chain. N6211 was seen easily, N6213 was a little harder, while M+10-24-32 and M+10-24-34 were very hard but positively detected multiple times.</li>
<li><b>NGC 6962 group:</b> N6962, N6964 and N6967 were seen easily, and N6961, although fainter, was fairly easily detected.</li>
<li><b>NGC 7184 group:</b> N7184, N7180, N7185 and N7188 seen easily within one field of view of 7mm eyepiece (217x, 22&#8242;)</li>
<li><b>NGC 7103 group:</b> N7103 and N7104 were detected fairly easily, IC 1393 a little harder, while IC 5124 and IC 5122 were very hard but positively detected multiple times.</li>
<li><b>NGC 7385 group:</b> N7385 and N7386 were easily seen. N7387, N7389, N7390 and N7383 were detected fairly easily. N7384 was barely detected.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Friday, October 8, 2010</h3>
<p><b>PK 080-6.1 (Cygnus Egg)</b> PN Cyg 21 02 45 +36 44 29 13.5 2010-10-08 08:20pm<br />
Appears as a slightly fuzzy tight double star. The components, aligned N-S, actually are the lobes of this proto-planetary nebula. The lobe to the N appears brighter.</p>
<p><b>NGC 7354</b> PN Cep 22 40 46 +61 20 51 12.9 2010-10-08 08:45pm<br />
Easily spotted in 9mm eyepiece (169x, 29&#8242;) as a small and moderately faint uniform round disc roughly 30&#8243; in diameter. Better seen in 7mm eyepiece (217x, 22&#8242;). OIII filter works well but does not bring out any additional details. Traces of annularity glimpsed. Two moderately faint (mag. 14.8) stars are located right outside the nebula to the W and SW. A faint star (mag. 15.9) is visible to the NW.</p>
<p><b>Palomar 12</b> GC Cap 21 47 17 -21 11 59 11.7 2010-10-08 09:20pm<br />
Very pale round glow, roughly 1.5&#8242; in diameter, barely detected with 16mm eyepiece (95x, 52&#8242;), better seen with 7mm eyepiece (217x, 22&#8242;). Located 2&#8242; NW of a small rectangle triangle of moderately bright stars. Note: I sketched the field and verified later on that the position was correct.</p>
<p><b>NGC 7507</b> GX Scl 23 12 44 -28 28 45 11.4 2010-10-08 10:35pm<br />
Small (~ 10&#8243;) bright round core, moderately faint halo 1.5&#8242; in diameter. Located 20&#8242; from dimmer NGC 7513.</p>
<p><b>NGC 7562</b> GX Psc 23 16 32 +06 45 02 12.6 2010-10-08 10:55pm<br />
Small (< 10") moderately bright core, faint halo roughly 1' in diameter, both very slightly elongated E-W. Located 2' W of a moderately faint (mag. 14.3) star. Faint (mag. 15.8) star 1.5 NW. Did not see NGC 7562A and 7557 (a DSS sheet of the region would have helped in locating those)

<b>NGC 7541</b> GX Psc 23 15 18 +04 35 48 12.5 2010-10-08 11:05pm<br />
3&#8217;x1&#8242; E-W, moderately faint, fairly uniform. Located 3&#8242; W of a moderatelt bright (mag. 13.0) star and 4&#8242; ENE of smaller and dimmer NGC 7537. Traces of mottling detected?</p>
<p><b>IC 10</b> GX Cas 00 21 01 +59 21 24 11.8 2010-10-08 11:40pm<br />
Extremely faint glow, about 2&#8217;x1&#8242; E-W. 2 moderately faint stars are superimposed, the brighter one to the W. A few more faint superimposed stars pop in and out of view.  Knowing where to look and what to look for helps tremendously here, and I had just looked at this object in Mark Johnston&#8217;s 18&#8243; scope prior to looking for it in my 12&#8243; scope. Otherwise, I probably would have missed it&#8230;</p>
<p><b>MCG-3-1-15 (WLM Dwarf)</b> GX Cet 00 02 33 -15 23 53 11.0 2010-10-09 12:00am<br />
Extremely pale glow, 15&#8217;x5&#8242; N-S. Moving the scope back and forth over the field helps to distinguish the object&#8217;s glow from the background sky.</p>
<p><b>NGC 24</b> GX Scl 00 10 31 -24 54 00 12.1 2010-10-09 12:30am<br />
4&#8217;x1&#8242; NE-SW. Fairly faint, uniform halo, only slightly brighter toward the center. Some mottling was suspected. A fairly bright star lays at the ENE end.</p>
<p><b>NGC 171</b> GX Cet 00 37 56 -19 52 20 13.0 2010-10-09 12:40am<br />
Fairly faint, round, 1&#8242; in diameter. Slightly brighter round core, 20&#8243; in diameter. Forms an isoceles triangle with 2 nearby field stars of similar brightness (mag. 10.8 and 11.5)  Note: NGC 171 = NGC 175 (see NGCBUGS for story)</p>
<h3>Saturday, October 9, 2010</h3>
<p><b>NGC 7785</b> GX Psc 23 55 54 +05 58 48 12.6 2010-10-09 10:45pm<br />
Almost stellar bright core, faint halo 1&#8217;x45&#8243; NW-SE. Moderately faint (mag. 14.7) star just outside the halo to the N. A few fairly bright stars visible in the same field of view of the 7mm eyepiece (217x, 22&#8242;)</p>
<p><b>NGC 125</b> GX Psc 00 29 25 +02 54 09 13.3 2010-10-09 11:05pm<br />
Moderately faint, round, about 30&#8243; in diameter, gradually brighter toward the center. 2 moderately faint (mag. 10.8 and 13.1) stars located just S. Forms a nice group with NGC 126, 127 (seen with great difficulty), 128 and 130, all seen in the same field of view of the 7mm eyepiece (217x, 22&#8242;)</p>
<p><b>NGC 7832</b> GX Psc 00 07 03 -03 39 09 14.3 2010-10-09 11:15pm<br />
Fairly faint, 45&#8243;x30&#8243; NE-SW, weak small core.</p>
<p><b>NGC 7635 (Bubble Nebula)</b> BN Cas 23 21 14 +61 16 22 11.0 2010-10-09 11:25pm<br />
Faint nebulosity around SAO 20575 (mag. 8.7), about 1&#8217;x45&#8243; E-W. With careful examination, using a 9mm eyepiece (169x, 29&#8242;) outfitted with an OIII filter, and knowing in advance what to look for, I was able to detect a faint extension to the E, arcing toward the SE. Another fairly bright star (SAO 20562, mag. 6.9), 5&#8242; WSW, also appears fuzzy (probably just scattering)</p>
<p><b>NGC 198</b> GX Psc 00 39 58 +02 51 40 13.1 2010-10-10 12:00am<br />
Round uniform glow, about 1&#8242; in diameter. Visible in the same field of view of the 7mm eyepiece (217x, 22&#8242;) as NGC 200, both galaxies being at the end of a nice galaxy chain.</p>
<p><b>IC 1613</b> GX Cet 01 05 29 +02 11 41 10.1 2010-10-10 12:15am<br />
Extremely pale glow, 10&#8217;x5&#8242; WNW-ESE, barely distinguishable from the background sky. Using a low power eyepiece (16mm, 95x, 52&#8242;) and moving back and forth over the expected position helps in convincing yourself that you&#8217;re actually seeing the darn thing!</p>
<p><b>NGC 315</b> GX Psc 00 58 26 +30 24 51 12.2 2010-10-10 12:30am<br />
Fairly bright small core (~ 20&#8243;), fairly faint round halo measuring roughly 1&#8242; in diameter. Faint star just 40&#8243; E. Another faint star 45&#8243; NNW. Visible in the same field of view of 7mm eyepiece (217x, 22&#8242;) as NGC 311.</p>
<p><b>NGC 514</b> GX Psc 01 24 40 +12 58 38 12.3 2010-10-10 01:00am<br />
Very faint uniform oval glow, 2&#8217;x1.5&#8242; E-W. Caught a glimpse of an almost stellar core (?) Located 2&#8242; W of a fairly bright star (HIP 6558)</p>
<p><b>NGC 660</b> GX Psc 01 43 38 +13 42 05 11.9 2010-10-10 01:05am<br />
Moderately faint halo 2&#8217;x1&#8242; NNE-SSW, brighter core 30&#8243;x15&#8243;.</p>
<p><b>NGC 665</b> GX Psc 01 45 32 +10 28 50 13.2 2010-10-10 01:10am<br />
Faint halo 45&#8243;x30&#8243; NW-SE, small (~ 15&#8243;) moderately bright round core.</p>
<p><b>NGC 718</b> GX Psc 01 53 49 +04 15 09 12.6 2010-10-10 01:15am<br />
Small (~ 10&#8243;) bright round core. Moderately faint round halo 1&#8242; in diameter showing hints of mottling.</p>
<p><b>NGC 706</b> GX Psc 01 52 26 +06 21 13 13.2 2010-10-10 01:20am<br />
Very faint uniform round glow, 45&#8243; in diameter. Located 45&#8243; SSW of a moderately faint (mag. 16.1!) field star.</p>
<p><b>NGC 741</b> GX Psc 01 56 57 +05 41 06 12.3 2010-10-10 01:25am<br />
Round, fairly faint, 30&#8243; in diameter. Forms a very tight couple with smaller and dimmer NGC 742, just to the E, sharing a common halo with NGC 741. Galaxy IC 1751 was barely detected in the same field of view of the 7mm eyepiece (217x, 22&#8242;)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I showed up at the entrance of the Hollister BLM access road, off of Little Panoche Rd, around 7pm, I saw Dr. Lee Hoglan, Craig Scull, Peter Nastcher, Tony Hurtado and Mark Johnston fiddling with the gate. Apparently, a land owner had added their own combo lock in addition to the existing lock, and nobody knew the combination code! As I was privately entertaining the idea of setting up my equipment on the gravel area in front of the gate, Lee decided to cut off the chain with a hack saw blade. At first, I didn&#8217;t think that it was going to work, but apparently, Lee had learned quite a few tricks while at Folsom, and managed to cut off one of the links in about 10 minutes (thank God for soft steel chains!). Using a pair of pliers, I then twisted the link and managed to open the gate. Victory!</p>
<p>We proceeded to setup on the large flat area in front of the observatory. It was a bit breezy early on, but the wind died down after sunset as it is often the case in that area. It was quite warm all night, and I was observing in nothing more than a pair of shorts and a thin long sleeve shirt.</p>
<p>After collimating, we looked at Venus, Saturn and the Moon, which were all pretty low over the western horizon, and noticed that the seeing was quite good! Antares&#8217; companion was readily visible in my 12&#8243; scope. Always a good sign!</p>
<p>In the middle of the night, Peter noticed that his scope was out of collimation. We later found out that it was due to the support of his secondary mirror getting loose. This incident prompted me to check my own collimation since I, too, was starting to see more coma than I am used to. Indeed, my collimation was a little off, and after adjusting the mirrors, everything became crisper. I don&#8217;t know what caused that shift on my scope, but I decided not to worry about it for now.</p>
<p>After midnight, the seeing went from good to spectacular. Peter was showing off Jupiter through his 24&#8243; StarMaster telescope armed with a binoviewer and a neutral density filter. This was the best view of Jupiter I have ever had. A lot of very fine details could be seen within the bands. The satellites were seen as tiny little discs of varying diameters and colors, making it easy to identify them. The GRS was crossing Jupiter&#8217;s meridian, followed by a long thin dark band (maybe signaling the reapparition of the SEB?)</p>
<p>Lyra&#8217;s double-double was showing a very clean split, and Peter suggested to try 72 Peg, which members are separated by only 0.5&#8243;. Sure enough, using my 12&#8243; scope, two tiny Airy discs touching each other were intermittently visible.</p>
<p>The transparency was good but not great. Jupiter was showing a tiny halo, and my NELM estimate was around 6.6, which is slightly below what the site is capable of. Nevertheless, M33 was fairly easily visible using averted vision, which I consider a good test for darkness and transparency.</p>
<p>As far as my observing log, this was not a night for the record books. I only logged the following 5 (new to me) objects:</p>
<p><b>M1-92</b> (Minkowski&#8217;s Footprint) PN Cyg 19 36 46 +29 34 28 11.0 2010-08-14 09:35pm<br />
Appears as a fairly bright fuzzy star at 305x, confirmed at 610x. It seemed extremely slightly elongated WNW-ESE with tiny faint extensions in the same direction (?) Forms a small triangle with two field stars of relatively comparable brightness. I did not try using a narrow band filter since I knew in advance that it would not help.</p>
<p><b>HP 1</b> (Haute-Provence 1) GC Oph 17 31 47 -29 59 26 12.5 2010-08-14 10:15pm<br />
Very pale round glow 45&#8243; in diameter. Confirmed the location with Mark Johnston&#8217;s 18&#8243; StarMaster telescope. In that scope, a tiny (10&#8243;) core, only very slightly brighter than the surrounding glow, was suspected (?)</p>
<p><b>Djorgovski</b> 2 GC Sgr 18 02 31 -27 49 34 9.9 2010-08-14 11:00pm<br />
Faint round glow 1.5&#8242; in diameter located 20&#8242; W of the famous ink spot (B86) and its neighboring open cluster NGC 6520. Positioned in the center of a keystone shaped asterism formed by 4 fairly bright stars. Another small (unnamed?) dark nebula is located 5&#8242; WNW. A very faint superimposed star was detected at the northern end of the cluster, and another one was also seen intermittently at the western end. Not sure whether these belong to the cluster or are simply field stars.</p>
<p><b>NGC 6412</b> (Arp 38) GX Dra 17 29 16 +75 42 06 12.4 2010-08-14 11:15pm<br />
Bright stellar nucleus surrounded by a diffuse featureless halo measuring 1.5&#8242; in diameter. A faint smudge was spotted 10&#8242; NW (?)</p>
<p><b>NGC 6621</b> (Arp 81) GX Dra 18 12 54 +68 22 15 13.3 2010-08-15 12:05am<br />
Faint diffuse glow 1.5&#8217;x30&#8243; elongated NW-SE containing two small condensations. The slightly larger and brighter one to the NW is the core of galaxy NGC 6621, while the other one is the core of its companion galaxy NGC 6622. A faint (mag. 15.3) star is located just 30&#8243; E of the core of NGC 6622.</p>
<p>I also tried to look at a number of tough objects, including Djorgovski 1 and the Aquarius Dwarf, but was not able to see them.</p>
<p>I finished the night with a quick look at a couple of galaxy groups in Pegasus using one of Alvin&#8217;s observing guides. I also looked at some of my favorites, including Stephan&#8217;s quintet, the Deer Lick group and M33.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>GSSP 2010 turned out to be a terrific star party, and I would like to start this report by personally thanking our hosts, the Albaugh family, as well as all the volunteers who made this event such a great success!</p>
<p>The conditions were good all 4 nights. The NELM hovered in the 6.8/7.0 range. Given the amount of haze that was clearly visible during the day, and especially shortly after sunset, I feel that the site used for GSSP could easily yield mag. 7.2 or better skies when the air is drier. The seeing was average most of the time, although a bit off on the first and the last night.</p>
<p>I had prepared a list of 58 objects drawn mostly from the Herschel II, DeepMap 600 and Tac Eye Candy lists. I also added a few Palomar globular clusters and obscure summer time planetaries, just for the heck of it. I ended up logging 48 new objects. Below is my log for all 4 nights. See you at GSSP 2011!</p>

<p><b>NGC 6070</b> GX Ser 16 10 33 +00 40 55 12.4 2010-07-10 10:40pm<br />
Fairly faint, relatively uniform, diffuse halo about 3&#8217;x1.5&#8242; ENE-WSW. Faint stellar nucleus glimpsed using averted vision. Located 8&#8242; SSE of a bright (mag. 6.7) yellow star. Two moderately faint stars were seen just outside the eastern end of the halo. PGC 57350 was detected as a small and very faint smudge 5&#8242; ENE.</p>
<p><b>NGC 6106</b> GX Her 16 19 20 +07 23 10 12.8 2010-07-10 10:55pm<br />
1&#8217;x45&#8243; NNW-SSE, fairly faint, relatively uniform, very slightly brighter core, faint stellar nucleus or superimposed star glimpsed using averted vision. Extremely faint star (mag. 14.4!) at the northern end, just outside the halo. Slightly brighter star (mag. 14.6!) located 1&#8242; S. The difference in the appreciation of their brightness is probably due to the fact that the first one is actually superimposed over the halo. Two fairly bright field stars are 10&#8242; SSW and SW.</p>
<p><b>NGC 6181</b> GX Her 16 32 50 +19 48 22 12.2 2010-07-10 11:05pm<br />
1.5&#8217;x1&#8242; NNE-SSW. Fairly bright small core or stellar nucleus. Moderately faint diffuse halo which appears uneven. Traces of a spiral arm extending NNE, and possibly a smaller and dimmer symmetrical one. Extremely faint superimposed star at the northern end (about 45&#8242; N of nucleus)</p>
<p><b>B 92</b> (Black Hole) DN Sgr 18 16 09 -18 10 45 O6 2010-07-11 12:10am<br />
Superimposed over the Small Sagitarius Star Cloud (M24) and visible in the same field of view of the Televue Panoptic 27mm with B93 and NGC 6603, this dark nebula measures 15&#8217;x8&#8242;, is oriented roughly N-S, and features a single fairly bright superimposed star located just E of the center.</p>
<p><b>Palomar 8</b> GC Sgr 18 42 10 -19 48 56 10.9 2010-07-11 12:20am<br />
Round, about 1.5&#8242; in diameter, moderately faint, uniform and unresolved smudge. Moderately faint star just south (?). 3 or 4 stars, either superimposed field stars or physically belonging to the cluster, were detected.</p>
<p><b>IC 1295</b> PN Sct 18 55 14 -08 48 46 12.7 2010-07-11 12:45am<br />
Visible at 95x without filter and with globular cluster NGC 6712 in the same field of view. At 217x + OIII filter, I see a faint roundish disk about 2&#8242; in diameter, relatively uniform with traces of annularity.</p>
<p><b>NGC 6717</b> (Palomar 9) GC Sgr 18 55 46 -22 41 13 8.4 2010-07-11 01:00am<br />
About 45&#8243;x30&#8243; E-W, moderately faint. Half a dozen stars are resolved. Located 2&#8242; S of a bright yellow/orange star.</p>
<p><b>NGC 6814</b> GX Aql 19 43 17 -10 17 48 12.1 2010-07-11 01:35am<br />
Moderately bright almost stellar core. Faint, round, diffuse halo, about 2&#8242; in diameter, showing hints of mottling. Faint superimposed star 30&#8243; W.</p>
<p><b>Palomar 11</b> GC Aql 19 45 50 -07 58 45 9.8 2010-07-11 01:45am<br />
Very faint round haze with a dozen superimposed field stars extending over an area roughly 5&#8242; in diameter. Located just 6&#8242; SSE of a fairly bright (mag. 8.6) field star.</p>
<p><b>NGC 6907</b> GX Cap 20 25 46 -24 46 17 11.9 2010-07-11 01:50am<br />
Moderately faint core, about 30&#8243; in diameter. Faint halo, about 2&#8217;x1.2&#8242; extending E-W. A small and faint detached knot is visible just NE of the core. Using averted vision, it&#8217;s pretty clear that it&#8217;s a spiral arm.</p>
<p><b>NGC 6991</b> OC Cyg 20 55 17 +47 27 25   2010-07-11 02:15am<br />
Roughly 60 fairly bright stars of similar brightness within an area 30&#8242; in diameter. A couple of chains, each made up of 5 or 6 stars, are visible in the western half. A bright, slightly yellow star is located at the eastern end of the cluster.</p>
<p><b>M 2-9</b> (Minkowski&#8217;s Butterfly) PN Oph 17 06 15 -10 09 26 13.2 2010-07-11 10:40pm<br />
Extremely faint nebulosity, extending approximately 30&#8243;x10&#8243; N-S. The central star is moderately faint. For some reason, the use of an O-III filter did not seem to help much.</p>
<p><b>NGC 6309</b> (Box Nebula) PN Oph 17 14 42 -12 55 22 11.6 2010-07-11 10:50pm<br />
Appears as an out of focus star at 95x. Blinks well using an O-III filter. Best seen at 305x. Measures roughly 20&#8243;x12&#8243; extending NNW-SSE. Fairly uniform. The northern half seems a bit brighter. A moderately faint (mag. 11.5) star is located 15&#8243; NNW. A very faint (mag. 15.0) star is 45&#8243; E. Finally, an extremely faint star is located just 5&#8243; W (?)</p>
<p><b>NGC 6340</b> GX Dra 17 10 17 +72 17 38 12.0 2010-07-11 11:05pm<br />
Moderately bright stellar nucleus. Gradually fainter round diffuse halo about 1.5&#8242; in diameter. Faint galaxy (IC 1251) about 7&#8242; NNW seen easily. Another one (IC 1254), just barely seen, is located 10&#8242; NE.</p>
<p><b>NGC 6507</b> OC Sgr 18 00 29 -17 27 01 9.6 2010-07-11 11:30pm<br />
Sparse group of two dozen moderately bright to fairly faint stars in an area measuring roughly 10&#8242; in diameter.</p>
<p><b>IC 1276</b> (Palomar 7) GC Ser 18 11 21 -07 12 37 10.3 2010-07-11 11:35pm<br />
Extremely faint round smudge, about 2&#8242; in diameter, seen using averted vision only, and surrounding two fairly faint stars separated by about 45&#8243; on an E-W line. An extremely faint star is located 1.2&#8242; E. Two moderately bright stars are roughly 3.5&#8242; N and NNE respectively.</p>
<p><b>NGC 6596</b> OC Sgr 18 18 12 -16 38 43   2010-07-11 11:45pm<br />
Two dozen fairly bright to moderately faint stars within an area 10&#8242; in diameter. Not very well detached from that part of the Milky Way. A dozen stars are arranged in a &#8220;C&#8221; shape.</p>
<p><b>NGC 6604</b> OC Ser 18 18 40 -12 14 12 7.5 2010-07-12 12:00am<br />
5 fairly bright stars arranged in a trapezoidal shape roughly 2&#8217;x1&#8242; E-W, the brightest member being slightly yellow. A few slightly dimmer stars are spread out within a few arc minutes.</p>
<p><b>NGC 6631</b> OC Sct 18 27 48 -12 01 21 11.7 2010-07-12 12:05am<br />
About 20 fairly faint stars within 5&#8242;. Another small group is located about 10&#8242; SE. Is it part of the same cluster?</p>
<p><b>NGC 6819</b> OC Cyg 19 41 42 +40 12 45 9.5 2010-07-12 01:10am<br />
About 25 moderately faint stars over a milky background within an area 4&#8242; in diameter. A round dark region about 2&#8242; in diameter is very obvious in the northern half of the cluster. A bright (mag. 6.2) yellow star is located 10&#8242; ENE while a bright (mag. 6.9) white star is only 14&#8242; SSE.</p>
<p><b>NGC 6857</b> PN Cyg 20 02 16 +33 34 13 11.4 2010-07-12 01:20am<br />
Faint round nebulosity about 30&#8243; in diameter, relatively uniform, very slightly brighter in its center. Without an O-III filter, the nebula is not very obvious, but a fairly faint superimposed star, slightly offset to the north, is visible. Is this the central star? Two moderately faint stars are located on either sides of the nebula on a NE-SW line. At 217x with an O-III filter, the nebula gives the impression of having an odd triangular shape, the northern side being flat&#8230;</p>
<p><b>NGC 6894</b> PN Cyg 20 16 51 +30 35 54 14.4 2010-07-12 01:35am<br />
Round, about 45&#8243; in diameter, fairly faint. Shows traces of ring structure, the central region, about 10&#8243; in diameter, being slightly darker. A knot is visible on the ring in the NNE direction. Since it almost completely disappears when using an O-III filter, it most likely is a superimposed star.</p>
<p><b>Abell 70</b> PN Aql 20 32 09 -07 03 01 14.3 2010-07-12 01:45am<br />
Ghostly smudge, barely visible using averted vision and an O-III filter. Seems round and uniform. It is also visible without a filter once you know exactly where to look. A moderately bright (mag. 11.1) star is located 3.5&#8242; E.</p>
<p><b>NGC 7129</b> OC Cep 21 43 16 +66 09 38 11.5 2010-07-12 02:35am<br />
5 moderately bright stars and 2 faint stars within an area measuring 5&#8242;. Some nebulosity can be seen around the brightest stars. Since that nebulosity seems to disappear entirely when using an O-III or UHC filter, it probably is a reflection nebula associated with this young cluster.</p>
<p><b>NGC 7139</b> PN Cep 21 46 28 +63 50 21 13.5 2010-07-12 02:45am<br />
Faint, round and uniform nebulosity about 1&#8242; in diameter. A moderately faint (mag.. 14.4) lies just outside the nebula in the SSE direction.</p>
<p><b>NGC 6530</b> OC Sgr 18 05 12 -24 21 27 5.1 2010-07-12 11:00pm<br />
Roughly 40 stars, most of which are fairly bright, within an area 10&#8242; in diameter. This cluster is embedded inside M8, the famous Lagoon Nebula, and is likely physically related. There is a tight double on the eastern side.</p>
<p><b>NGC 6546</b> OC Sgr 18 08 03 -23 17 42 8.2 2010-07-12 11:10pm<br />
Seen as a faint smudge in 9&#215;50 finder scope. Fairly inconspicuous, round, measuring about 15&#8242; in diameter, this cluster contains two dozen moderately bright stars and at least as many faint stars over a milky background. There is a tight double at the western end.</p>
<p><b>IC 4634</b> PN Oph 17 02 13 -21 50 30 12.0 2010-07-12 11:40pm<br />
Appears as an out of focus star, even at 305x. Blinks well using an O-III filter. Roundish, about 10&#8243; in diameter, extremely slightly elongated N-S, fairly bright and uniform. Possible sighting of an extremely faint envelope extending 25&#8243; in diameter (although this may just be scattering).</p>
<p><b>NGC 6548</b> GX Her 18 06 29 +18 35 23 12.7 2010-07-12 11:40pm<br />
Very faint round diffuse halo, about 1.5&#8242; in diameter. Moderately bright core 30&#8243;x20&#8243; elongated NNW-SSE &#8211; this galaxy appears to be a face on barred spiral. An extremely faint superimposed star is located 1&#8242; ESE, and another one is 1.2&#8242; ENE. Very faint NGC 6549 is visible in the same field of view.</p>
<p><b>NGC 6058</b> PN Her 16 04 50 +40 39 21 13.0 2010-07-13 12:10am<br />
Moderately bright, uniform, very slightly elongated N-S, about 25&#8243; in diameter. Fairly bright central star. Located inside an equilateral triangle formed by 3 fairly bright stars.</p>
<p><b>NGC 6155</b> GX Her 16 26 28 +48 20 46 13.2 2010-07-13 12:25am<br />
1.2&#8217;x50&#8243; elongated NW-SE. Fairly faint and uniform, only slightly and gradually brighter towards the center.</p>
<p><b>Palomar 6</b> GC Oph 17 44 24 -26 13 42 11.6 2010-07-13 12:30am<br />
Not seen with 12&#8243; scope. Using Mark Johnston&#8217;s 18&#8243; F/3.7 StarMaster telescope at 216x, this globular cluster shows as an extremely pale glow.</p>
<p><b>NGC 6804</b> PN Aql 19 32 07 +09 14 58 12.4 2010-07-13 12:50am<br />
Faint round glow about 1&#8242; in diameter. 3 superimposed stars are visible on an E-W line. I suspect the one in the center to be the central star that gave birth to this planetary nebula. Using an O-III filter, traces of annularity seem to be visible, especially in the northern region (?)</p>
<p><b>NGC 6793</b> OC Vul 19 23 43 +22 09 49   2010-07-13 01:00am<br />
I counted 35 stars within an area 8&#8242; in diameter, 20 of which are fairly bright. Slightly elongated NNE-SSW.</p>
<p><b>NGC 6800</b> OC Vul 19 27 35 +25 09 46   2010-07-13 01:05am<br />
30 fairly bright stars and at least as many faint stars located within 14&#8242;. Pretty sparse with large areas free of stars. This cluster is also named the &#8220;Sea Turtle&#8221; cluster.</p>
<p><b>NGC 6824</b> GX Cyg 19 43 57 +56 08 07 13.0 2010-07-13 01:35am<br />
Fairly bright core measuring about 30&#8243;x20&#8243; elongated NE-SW. Faint halo extending 1&#8217;x40&#8243; in the same direction. Very faint superimposed star at the SW end of the halo. Moderately faint field star 30&#8243; N.</p>
<p><b>NGC 7026</b> (Cheeseburger Nebula) PN Cyg 21 06 42 +47 53 38 12.0 2010-07-13 02:05am<br />
Best seen at 610x (Nagler 5mm + Barlow 2x). Located 30&#8243; WSW of a moderately bright (mag. 9.6) star, this nebula is composed of 2 moderately bright lobes oriented NE-SW separated by a dark lane, hence the name of &#8220;Cheeseburger Nebula&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<p><b>NGC 7031</b> OC Cyg 21 07 35 +50 55 03 11.0 2010-07-13 02:30am<br />
About 20 moderately bright stars within 5&#8242;. A nice red star is easily noticeable at the northern end of this cluster.</p>
<p><b>NGC 7048</b> PN Cyg 21 14 40 +46 19 55 11.0 2010-07-13 02:40am<br />
Faint uniform disk 1&#8242; in diameter. Faint superimposed star or knot at the NNW boundary. Located just north of a moderately bright (mag. 10.2) star.</p>
<p><b>NGC 6166</b> GX Her 16 29 02 +39 31 49 12.9 2010-07-13 10:40pm<br />
Moderately faint, measuring about 45&#8243;, very slightly elongated NE-SW, gradually brighter towards its center. This elliptical galaxy is the brightest member of the cluster of galaxies Abell 2199. Many members of that cluster are visible in the same field of view.</p>
<p><b>NGC 6239</b> GX Her 16 50 27 +42 43 25 12.9 2010-07-13 10:50pm<br />
1&#8217;x30&#8243; E-W, moderately faint, gradually brighter towards its center. Using Tom Osypowski&#8217;s 30&#8243; F/3.3 telescope, this galaxy appears much bigger and brighter but fails to show additional details.</p>
<p><b>IC 4756</b> OC Ser 18 39 33 +05 27 39 5.4 2010-07-13 11:45pm<br />
Seen naked eye as a faint smudge! Using a Panoptic 27mm (65x, 1.2 deg TFOV), this cluster shows about 40 fairly bright stars in an area measuring roughly 30&#8242; in diameter. A group of stars near the center delimit an oval region measuring 8&#8217;x4&#8242; NE-SW that is almost devoid of stars. Half a dozen stars form a chain to the ENE. Finally, there is a small group of 6/7 stars to the WNW that seems to be a region of higher density in this cluster.</p>
<p><b>NGC 6760</b> GC Aql 19 11 46 +01 03 02 9.0 2010-07-14 12:00am<br />
This globular cluster measures about 3&#8242; in diameter. The core region is moderately bright and measures about 1&#8242;. A few individual stars located in the outer region pop in and out of view.</p>
<p><b>NGC 6772</b> PN Aql 19 15 11 -02 41 13 14.0 2010-07-14 12:10am<br />
Best seen using an O-III filter. Very dim, round, about 1&#8242; in diameter, fairly uniform with maybe traces of annularity (?)</p>
<p><b>NGC 6778</b> PN Aql 19 19 00 -01 34 32 13.3 2010-07-14 12:20am<br />
Fairly bright, 20&#8243;x15&#8243; E-W, uniform. Appears slightly rectangular, with the central section being a little narrower.</p>
<p><b>NGC 6765</b> PN Lyr 19 11 33 +30 33 51 12.9 2010-07-14 12:55am<br />
Appears as a fairly bright bar measuring 30&#8243;x15&#8243; NE-SW embedded inside a very faint round glow about 35&#8243; in diameter.</p>
<p><b>B 142</b> DN Aql 19 40 14 +10 32 33 O5 2010-07-14 01:15am<br />
Best seen using a Panoptic 27mm (65x, 1.2 deg TFOV). Large dark nebula, about 40&#8217;x10&#8242; WNW-ESE, located in a moderately dense region of the Milky Way. The eastern half is wider and less dense as a larger number of stars shine through. In particular, two fairly bright stars shine through, one to the NE and one to the SE.</p>
<p><b>NGC 6811</b> OC Cyg 19 37 38 +46 24 48 9.0 2010-07-14 01:30am<br />
Detected in 9&#215;50 finder scope. Contains about 50 moderately bright stars within an area 12&#8242; in diameter. Several dark areas/lanes can be seen throughout. Appears fairly conspicuous due to its much higher density than the surrounding area.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few of us went to the D.A.R.C. observatory last night, including Robert Jardine (aka &#8220;Joe Bob&#8221;), Al Smith and his wife Annie, Al Howard, Eric Zbinden, Daniel Stefanescu, and of course Dr Lee Hoglan and Dr Bob Caton.</p>
<p>Before it turned dark, Bob Caton organized a short lecture on Kuiper belt objects, some of which he had imaged from his home in Modesto. He also shared a few recent photographs of M101 he had taken from his private observatory, and talked about future plans for the D.A.R.C. observatory, including the installation of a 50&#8243; dobsonian telescope.</p>
<p>Observing conditions were pretty good. There was no wind, except maybe for the occasional light &#8220;refreshing&#8221; breeze. The seeing was rather mediocre. The dry air, coming from the north, allowed for good transparency (NELM: 6.6). In addition, it was warm enough that it felt comfortable to wear nothing more than a pair of shorts and a light long sleeve shirt.</p>
<p>I spent a couple of hours observing a dozen or so Herschel II objects in Libra and Bootes. Then, I moved on to some eye candy in the Summer milky way, using my newly acquired Lumicon O-III filter. Finally, I got to play with the JMI 16&#8243; binocular telescope. Pretty cool! By the way, I took a quick look at M13 and finally saw the propeller! (thank you, Richard Ozer, for pointing it out to me on a photograph last month!)</p>
<p>Joe Bob and I looked for comet McNaught using our binoculars around 2:30am, but we could not spot it (it was supposed to be right near M34, which was very easily visible in our binoculars in spite of its low elevation)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I went to Lake San Antonio on Tuesday, May 11, in order to wrap up the Herschel 400 list, which I have been working on for almost a year and a half. I was missing 15 targets, all of them in Virgo. To make the night worth the trip, I added a few interesting targets from the TAC Eye Candy list, which I had installed in SkyTools.</p>
<p>The conditions were actually pretty decent. The sky was perfectly clear and the transparency was good. It was a little windy early on, but it turned calm by 10pm. The seeing was average or slightly below average. The temperature dropped to 38F by 2am. There was very little humidity, and my paper charts and log paper remained pretty dry all night. I was the only person in the overflow parking lot, and I have to admit that it felt a little spooky at times&#8230;</p>
<p>After observing all the targets I had planned (around 1am), I decided to celebrate the completion of the Herschel 400 project by observing a few very bright targets (mostly Messier objects), and stared at the rising Summer Milky Way, trying to convince myself that warmer nights are in our near future&#8230;</p>
<p>Below is my log for the night. The entire Herschel 400 log can be found at:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Tuesday, April 6, I joined Marko, Rogelio, Hans Schulze and Paul Duncan at Dinosaur Point for a night of observing. Conditions were decent with fairly calm winds, average transparency and seeing, temps in the mid to low 40s and low humidity. Dew was not a problem at all, and my paper charts remained mostly dry. We got to observe Mercury shortly after sunset, but it didn&#8217;t show any detail due to the strong atmospheric refraction and horrible seeing at such low altitude. After that, I observed Herschel II objects in Leo and a few Herschel 400 objects in Virgo. Marko, who was busy imaging (traitor! :-), let me use his StarMaster 18&#8243; dobsonian. This thing is &#8230; sweet! It moves like butter, stays still while focusing, and I was amazed by how much brighter objects looked compared to when observed through my 12&#8243;. I can&#8217;t wait to resume work on my own 16&#8243; scope. Thanks again Marko!</p>
<p>Two days later, on Thursday, April 8, Rogelio and I met at Lake San Antonio. I passed him on Highway 101 shortly after leaving Salinas, and we followed each other from that point on. Conditions were pretty good, with an estimated NELM around 6.7 and average seeing. Humidity was rather high, and my paper charts and log paper were pretty soaked (although interestingly enough, it seemed to come in waves&#8230;). Rogelio was imaging and taking naps during exposures while I was busy observing Herschel II objects in UMa and Herschel 400 objects in Virgo. Among other things, I observed 3C 273, a quasar located in the constellation Virgo (the first quasar ever to be identified, it&#8217;s located about 2.5 billion light years away from us!). It was pretty cold (not sure how cold it got, but when I woke up in the morning, my car was clocking at 38F) and I had to bail out around 1:30am. I slept like a baby until about 7:30am. On my way out of the Lake San Antonio campgrounds, I was careful not to hit any bunnies or deers when I saw a herd of wild boars. Cool! I was back at work at 11am, with a big smile on my face. Now that&#8217;s some serious addiction to dark skies ;-)</p>
